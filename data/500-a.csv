False,0,Going tonight!! 
False,0,I know right 
False,0,I get to go this evening. Whoooooo Star Wars!

False,0,Right? Unfortunately i need to wait until tomorrow night so my family and girlfriend can come
False,0,and my lightsaber
False,0,i had to sneak my sith robes in

False,0,Scruffy looking too!
False,0,Maybe in the EU he could but in the new canon as far as we know he can't 
False,0,"Yes but at one point Vader fell so deep into a sith rage that he shot not blue, but red sith lightning"
False,0,No you need a limbs to use force lightning
False,0,"He did know, and at one time he made slight modifications to his suit to allow him to briefly use lightning...he could use it but not as often or as long, with his modifications he could use it without taking as much damage.....still a risky move on his part though"

False,0,Battlefront is great but I'm waiting for some clone wars dlc
False,0,No! Battlefront is amazing!!
False,1,"The game is phenomenal, I waited for years for it to come out on the 360. Now that it's on the next gen consoles, it makes it even better. The graphics are magnificent.  At this moment in time it's a little dumbed down which is a tad disappointing, but it's still great. From what I hears the DLC's are something to look forward to. Everybody keeps complaining about the lack of ""campaign"" style gameplay. It doesn't bother me though because the original Battlefronts were always more of a multiplayer game to me anyway. I bought Battlefront about a week after I bought Black Ops 3, and I haven't barely touched BO3 since."
False,0,"It's a fun game in short bursts. All EA had to do was give Battlefront 2 AMAZING graphics, and it would've been fine. But they went ahead, and made a game that's worse compared to its predecessors. But it does do a good job of making you feel as if you're in Star Wars."
False,0,It's a great game for people who love Star Wars 
False,0,"Thanks for all the kind words of wisdom everyone, i think as a Star Wars fan i will get it, Star Wars is the best...may the force be with you all"
False,0,I love it the only probably I have is finding lobbies
False,0,No it's quite the game for a star wars fan. The only problems are some op stuff. But I look forward to the extensions. It is an amazing game!

False,0,I liked revenge of the with and that's it
False,0,"I really love episodes II and III, I like episode I as well because it's the beginning of everything but I prefer the other two. "
False,0,"My all time fave is episode III. I agree with Fallen Jedi 0124 that watching Anakin's fall and how the twins came to be just really fascinates me. Not to mention the battle scenes and the film score, (Anyone else a John Williams fan?), also contributed to my love for ROTS. "
False,0, I like all of the movies  they are all awesome    I don't know why most people don't like the first one
False,0,"I think alot has to do with your age when the prequels came out.
I was in high school when TPM came out and hated it, but my little cousin adored it and loves it to this day."
False,2,"People will hate me for this, but I absolutely loved The Phantom Menace. I don't mind Jar Jar at all. And I love all the prequels. Attack of the clones is my least favorite. But I hate when people bash films because they chose CGI over practical effects. We're in a day and age where it's literally impossible to tell the difference. All the star wars films were great. Some were better than others, but people hate on the prequels just to hate "

False,0,She would be a sky walker either way if we're assuming Han only had kids with Leia. But it is Han we are talking about.
False,0,She might be Skywalker..
False,0,Got to be a Skywalker
False,0,Then who is the Rey's mother? Anyone think about that?
False,0,He is the son of Han Solo and Lea. So to both I guess 
False,0,"Don't know how she could be Luke's daughter, I mean Jedi aren't supposed to have sex. And surely like wouldn't have gone against the Jedi Code after he became a fully fledged Jedi Master."
False,0,"The only person she could actually be related to is Han Solo, as his sister. But I seriously doubt that."
False,0,I really hope she's not a solo anyway I don't want to see another brother and sister thing. Probably a skywalker.
False,0,Luke's daughter she is! 
False,0,I think she isn't related to anyone. A new force altogether. Her getting the lightsaber is literally handing off to the next generation. The   Skywalker line isn't the future of the force.
False,0,Its really really good 
False,0,Just finished watching it an hour ago and I walked out of vue thinking wow 
False,0,"Go, don't wait. Go! Go now! "
False,0,Was it really good? I have yet to see it.
False,0,I read somewhere that the reason Boba survived was because of his armour that stopped him from being digested

False,0,"
He is in the previews. He is the guy that touches R2 with the metal hand. Remember because the only other person with a metal arm was anikan/darth vader and he has dies and become one with the force. So that only leaves Luke the only one with a metal hand. He also couldn't be Kylo Ren because Kylo is pretty much the second hand man in the group that he was in so Luke would have to be have to be in that group for a LONG time to be that high and he wouldn't be able to hide that for that long ( many Yoda). So therefore 1) he is in the trailers and 2) he isn't Kylo Ren. "
False,0,I don't know. It is an interesting theory 
False,0,I can confirm it is great. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything for you. That would be a dick move

False,0,"Yeah, lol. Because Kylo isn't Jacen at all, who went darkside as well. And there wasn't another superweapon in the EU. Hahaha, this is so amusing. EU may be non-canon, but as we can see, it doesn't differentiate much."
False,0,"Wait for it Brandon, just wait. It is Disney we are talking about here."
False,0,"I'm not disappointed at all. I didn't like most of the EU, and I'm glad making it non-canon meant that the filmmakers were free of its many creative restrictions."

False,0,I think republican is not into finding the Sith and kill them all. They just want to live peace and have happy life. Or they don't want to get into the fight between the forces. But the resistance wants to fight them because they know the Sith will never stop trying to build their empire again. And Leia wants to find Kylo and Luke. 
False,0,"What I meant was, why is it the Resistance fighting the First Order and not the Republic Fleet?
For that matter, why can the first order field a fighting force so much larger than what the Resistance can deploy?
Is it just that the Galaxy is so messed up, the the Republic is being bogged down in a million small insurgencies?"

False,0,Then we'll have to make do with that for the time being now won't we? Take some time to appreciate the fact that there are more Star Wars movies. The new film wasn't made to please everyone. And the other 2 wont be either.
False,1,"Yes, in the expanded universe. You all seem to be avoiding the point I made regarding Disney literally copying the EU, despite saying they didn't want to do so. All we have is a worse version of Jacen Solo and a worse version of A New Hope. "
False,0,"Oh and as for ""weak and pathetic"", he is extremely strong in the force, and only still an apprentice. Have you seen other Siths look into the minds of beings while using the force like that"
False,0,"Same movie??? Are u mental? It is a  genius move. Give the old fans new stuff to look at and to tune new ones, old things . It is refreshing. Have tons of references and Easter eggs . Too bad I missed it all."
False,0,"It was brilliant, some have missed the point. Its the future of the past."
False,1,"He's weak and pathetic. My issue is with the fact that they should have just followed the expanded universe if they wanted to do that. Create something original, don't copy something to a worse degree and then pass it off as original."
False,0,I thought it was good and I feel they've made Kylo ren out as weak but temperamental as over the films he's going to grow in power! They said in it that his training isn't complete yet  
False,1,"My review on it from the midnight launch

Spoilers btw

Just got back from the midnight launch of the long awaited Star Wars episode 7. 

Thanks a lot Disney, it has to be on par with the Phantom Menace. If it weren't for the fact that the script was a tiny bit better I'd say it was worse than episode 1.

The new characters are, as a whole, awful. Daisy Ridley was far too much a Kiera Knightley wannabe - it felt like I was watching a poor version of Elizabeth Swan from Pirate's of the Caribbean. As for John Boyega, he had some witty remarks, but overall seemed very confused about how to go about playing his role. He's not wholly to blame though, because the part he had written for him was terrible - well done again Disney. 

Oscar Isaac was a lot less painful to watch and actually did a very good job I thought. It was a pity that he was in it a lot less than other new people. 

As for Adam Driver playing Kylo Ren, what in the blazes was going on when that moron got the part? He did such a bad job, I actually felt like crying. He was the whiniest, most pathetic bad guy I think I've ever seen in Star Wars. Also, how on earth does a trained fighter in the arts of the dark side lose a lightsaber duel to a scavenger girl that's never even held a lightsaber before? WHAT IS THIS? He actually made me think everyone was going to hug and make up at the end, as he lacked so many of the qualities needed for an effective plot. General Hux, played by Domhnall Gleeson, looked like a parody of a wannabe nazi officer. He was not scary at all. The claims that this was supposed to be the darkest Star Wars yet were definitely not captured here. 

What gets me most is that Disney said the extended universe wasn't canon and yet they LITERALLY COPIED THE STORY but made it worse. Kylo Ren being the son of Han and Leia is a worse version of what actually happened in the Extended Universe where Jacen Solo, one of the three Solo children, becomes a Jedi (trained by Luke Skywalker - much like Kylo Ren) but turns to the Sith over the years because he wants to stop a Sith Lord taking over the Galaxy, but unfortunately becomes what he wanted to stop. He eventually becomes the Sith and inflicts a reign of terror on everyone for a while before Boba Fett (who doesn't die in the Extended a Universe - yeah thanks again Disney) trains Jacen's sister to rise up and kill her brother. It's a much better story and Jacen is not a whiney little moron. IF YOU THINK YOU CAN WRITE BETTER THAN THE AUTHORS OF THE EXTENDED UNIVERSE THEN DON'T COPY THE STORIES!!!!!!! 

One of the things I used to enjoy about Star Wars was the whole listening to Aliens make sounds in their language and then reading the subtitles as this was very engaging. Let's not have an alien on some weird Tatooine rip off planet shout, ""hey that's mine"", like he's a little child. 

As for the lightsaber fights, I have to say it was not a lot better than episode 4's fight between Vader and Obi Wan. They had enough time, they should have been trying to top Anakin and Obi Wan's fight in episode 3, not a stick fight down the park. Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor trained for six months in sword fighting to get ready for that fight and I highly doubt as much preparation went into episode seven, as the lightsaber fight was abysmal compared to what's been before. 

The fact that it repeats things and isn't original at all is reflected further by the fact that they copy the original trilogy in thinking, 'let's have a Death Star... but just make it bigger'. Very unoriginal and not very thrilling, as we've seen it all before! 

There were some good parts and the BB-8 droid was probably the star of this Star Wars, however he doesn't come close to the brilliance of R2-D2. The film was at its best when it made references to, or used actors, droids, weapons, ships etc from the prequels/original trilogy. The new stuff just didn't cut it. 

Last of all though, what made Disney kill Han Solo? This is the most despicable and insulting move to make against the original trilogy, especially seeing as he was killed by Kylo Ren, the awful wannabe Sith Lord. Dear oh dear Disney. That really was the final kick in the teeth."

False,0,"Does finn have the force
"
False,1,Say no more please
False,0,Obi wan trained him perfectly because obi wan is the most amazing jedi in the galaxy
False,0,"No, Obi-Wan was far less strict with Anakin, Qui-Gon was kind of more strict and would have pulled Anakin back to the light everytime conflict was within him."
False,0,"I think so, Qui Gon would've trained him the same way Obi Wan did because that's how Qui Gon taught him, so fate would've taken him on the same path"
False,0,Not sure.  We are who we are; maybe if there is another episode it would be wonderful to see him back on the good side.
False,0,. . . Or you can just read/listen to Darth Plagiues. . . 
False,1,"There is a ""theory"" that he used a mask while he was a senator and chancellor. This mask is a dark side trick but when the user is damaged the true face of the user is revealed. In this time the damage is the lightning. So both ""theory"" is true."
False,0,The lightning had a hand in it
False,0,Shoulda let Windu kill him
False,1,"Nope, it's true. His ""kindly Senator"" face was just a kind if mask. The lightning just revealed his real body. "
False,0,"Nah, thats a wonderfull theory bit it was when Mace Windu deflected Palpatine's sith lightning back on him"
False,0,Jedi who secretly a sith :~)
False,0,Jedi
False,0,All about that Sith life

False,0,Sith lord. I await an opponent to challenge me!

False,0,"JaYoda nailed it. Qui-gon tells Yoda his force ghost training was incomplete.
But... that makes me wonder... any chance of a Yoda force ghost in ep viii or ix?"
False,1,"He didn't fully master the Ghost Force. Clone Wars last episode explains it all. 

Also if you remember, anakin doesn't disappear once he dies either but later showed himself in ghost form. "
False,0,Qui Gon is united with the force. He told Yoda that he can learn it.(Clone Wars season 6 i think)
False,0,He was the first to master the Netherworld of the force
False,0,If not then how does he train obi-wan in the after life?
False,0,Not everyone becomes united with the Force when dead...
False,0,I feel you. I'm going into total black out after tonight
False,0,Good thing you aren't in attack of the clones.

False,0,Waiting till Thursday!
False,0,Ive seen it expect it to be like a new hope honestly 
False,0,"Yeah, its difficult when you've seen a movie that's so epic and you know you can't say anything because of spoilers"
False,0,Me too!
False,0,"Cant wait til everyone has seen it, I'm dying to discuss abouy everything that happened"
False,0,"A friend just received a spoiler (how the movie ends....) . He is pissed off. We lost him to the dark side. I will watch sw7 tonight. Daaaamn, I'm anxious!"
False,1,May the force be with you...and i feel at home here too....life is rough...it is nice to escape the constant fighting

False,0,I accidentally clicked on it when I was on the cyborg page . I haven't Sejm TFA yet! Life Ruined!!!
False,0,DONT DO IT
False,0,Yep. That guys is a dick
False,0,"Depends on what era are you interested in. If it is Old Republic, then you can start with Revan (if you know KOTORs), or Darth Bane. Darth Plagueis is great, too, for better feeling about E1. Han Solo trilogy is awesome and provides great connection to ANH. Then X-Wing series and Thrawn trilogy, That should be enough for the beginning."
False,0,Fate Of The Jedi series
False,0,Thrawn trilogy
False,1,"He was a kaleesh warrior which was sabotaged by dooku but he said it was the jedi and it was the nvm this is too hard to explain just look it up on YouTube ""General Grevious life"" its like an hour long but worth it"
False,1,He was a warrior and then lost his limbs... count dooku then found him( just like Palpatine) and creared him into a cyborg... 
False,0,Lol....TFA by any chance Darth Girl Power?
False,0,There taking a break till January.....  But I heard of a little film that might tide you over until then.
False,0,It was a shock staff. Similar to the magnaguard staffs I'm guessing Finn will fight that stormtrooper to get some practice before he fights kylo ren.
False,0,New one Doesnt cum out till january but I heard there's a little film to tide us over...
False,0,Yeah... he does and it is not easy to watch.
False,0,"I think he died, i believe that his story was told completely, like millions of voices where screaming and suddenly shut down"
False,0,Many tears were shed
False,0,I said not to read so not my fault. Sorry though 
False,0,Dang it. What a sad day to be star wars fan. 
False,0,Shit I shouldn't have read this 
False,0,Yes 
False,1,"Good idea! I feel you! I don't like spoilers either, so in a friendly way, please don't spoil the movie for us who have not seen it yet!"
False,0,"Yeah, I don't wanna read spoilers, so I go on SW forum. Good job mate."
False,0,No ones joking about cancer....
False,0,Dude...i hate people posting spoilers as much as the next guy....but cancer isn't really a joke
False,0,"Wow, you cant expect it not to be spoiled in such a long period of time"

False,0,"Nope, too long, i cam barely wait for Saturday....the day i get to go"
False,0,Ikr I could never do that
False,0,I just read that somebody is waiting for dvd release of it....now that takes epic proportions of patience in my book
False,0,I agree hold of until 12:01A.M Saturday to talk about the movie in-depth please!
False,0,"Dude, you're telling them too much!"
False,0,Ahahaha he's right 
False,0,He's full of Crap. 
False,0,Didn't have to say that he was his son!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
False,0,"Just watched it, Kyle Ren, his son himself killed him...I'm so sorry for this."
False,0,No he didn't. His death takes place after this movie's timeline
False,0,Yes he did God please everyone just quit talking about it 
False,0,Sorry I'm freaking out here
False,0,Dude. Stahp. 
False,0,"Yes New Zealand was i believe very quick to get it...it is at my theater today but why is every place getting it earlier than tomorrow, the actual release date?"
False,0,New Zealand must have been one of the first places to see it then. 
False,0,Same
False,0,"Thank you for not being like Red Leader....and no, it gets to my theater tomorrow but i have to wait until Friday"
False,0,I watched it 14 hours ago. Definitely an entertaining movie. There are only two major things which annoy me. But I won't say what they are...yet.
False,0,"So you haven't seen it yet?
"
False,0,No...not until its been seen by people...i dont want any info or spoilers
False,0,I hope so....Han is too great to die
False,0,You will see 
False,0,"Yeah he is just trying to get attention
"
False,0,"I hope he doesnt die...but....i can see it happening Ford wanted Solo dead in ROTJ, he begged Lucas to kill him off but Lucas wanted Solo alive....i hope he lives though, besides Anakin Skywalker he ismy second favorite"
False,0,"I just got out of the movie so I don't have the distance to rank it definitely, but WAY better than prequels and I'd say better than ep IV. On par with ep v and vi."
False,0,It's a good film. Worth the watch. 
False,0,"Practically reboot of ANH. As an EU fan, the story really didn't surprise me. I knew this story already, plus minus."
False,0,Amazing best yet
False,0,I think that there is just some technical stuff you don't need to worry about
False,0,"May I ask what you mean by ""in a sense""?"
False,0,In a sense you are correct 
False,0,"His skin colour literally has nothing to do with it? 
Why did anyone get the role? 
Just because he's black doesn't mean that is the only reason he is in there. 
Like fuck me for a bunch of nerds you're all judgemental racist cunts. "
False,1,"Although put bluntly, I agree with Red Guard. ^ "
False,1,"Politically inserted character.

There really isn't much to say about him until seeing the movie since Jar Jar Abrams decided to ignore cannon.

They're definitely building on him and other characters to take over the mantle of Star Wars from Fisher Ford and Hamill.

But from all the interviews comments by casting crew the only reason he got the spot was because they needed a token black guy"
False,0,"Look, Rowyn, there's no need to belittle this theory as ""absurd"" or ""stupid"". Everyone is entitled to think and believe what they want and share what they think on this app. You can post your own thoughts without condemning others. "
False,0,"When and where does he say that he did that?   If he was able to do that and not tell she had twins and didn't take theres as well. . . 

If anything, the notion that Vader all but killed Pademe is reenforced in Battlefront when Vader does not finish the force choke and the female traitior is still damaged

Either way, the ""stealing life force"" is absurd to stupid"
False,0,Sideous says it himself. Anyone who is anyone knows how the sith manipulate the force. It's not absurd at all
False,0,"The ""stole her life force"", theory is absurd.  Anakin did enough damage and weakened her enough for her to not be able to survive childbirth.

If someone has an example where a Sith could take a life force, while not being on the same planet no less, please share.  Cause if that could be done, I'm sure a few of the movies would have been shorter "
False,0,"I know. When I heard this theory, it really blew my mind. "
False,0,That's the theory I'm referring to. I would say that Is entirely true
False,0,My god...
False,3,"Sidious took Padmé's life Force and gave it to Anakin. The Droids on Polis Massa claim that she has lost the will to live but they are droids and cannot feel the Force. Even Obi-wan questions them with ""she's dying?"" because he can still feel the Force in her and her struggle to hold on. Therefore she has not lost the will to live. 
Because Padmé was hidden away on Polis Massa, her death could not have leaked out so, the only way Sidious could have told Anakin that Padmé was dead was if he was connected to her through the Force.
Anakin/Vader also claims that he felt that she was alive just a minute before he is ""complete"", so throughout the surgery Sidious was feeding off Padmé's life Force to keep Anakin alive and only when the surgery was over did Padmé die. "
False,0,"Her heart was broken by Anakin's fall to the dark side...and he was so angry without meaning to he reached out with the force and killed her, Sidious took most of her life force but Vader basically finished her off with his last outburst"
False,0,"Apparently she lost the ""will to live"""
False,0,"6 dlcs and how many of them should have been actual gameplay released when the game was released?

The game predominantly is a multiplayer online only game with zero playability offline.

But hey we have something to look forward too they're going to release downloaded content sorry anyone who buys again now is buying a broken game that's over price with zero replayability offline.

There's a basic element of Star Wars Battlefront that have been around and have made it what it was, galactic conquest, offline mode, story, characters, vehicles, space combat, I mean the list can go on.

False,0,Some Jedi have mastered this ability to such a degree as to be able to deflect a lightsaber with their bare hands. 
False,0,"Actually, it's a common Force ability called tutamis, the absorbtion of energy. It's used for a wide use of purposes, from shielding oneself from excess sunlight or radiation, to, in its most advanced forms, absorbing and even deflecting blaster bolts or Force lightning. It's how Vader deflected Han's shots during the Cloud City ambush. Most Jedi are incapable of such advanced uses of tutaminis, though. "

False,0,Yeah that was Anakin's extremely low moment. I'm glad the massacre wasn't displayed.

He learn both sides and he learn things only one could only dream O Hara go Luke Skywalker is the man"

What if Ben is actually Caedus, and Rey is his sister (twin or not), and they basically take on the roles of Jacen and Jaina.

False,0,Why do you think?

False,0,In season five episode one he fights off savage and Darth maul and cuts one of their arms off and literally just shows his skill and why he is amazing. But I agree he does get so much exposure people don't care all too much 
False,2,It would be great to read a book about his time at the Jedi academy and his journey to a Jedi master.
False,0,He beat grievous I think that says enough
False,0,Art alpha class they are the best of the best of the arc troopers the archers are the best of the clone troopers which means we have the best of the best first some clone trooper who specializes in short recon so it's basically saying here is a 12 gauge shotgun then giving the other opponent a wood chip
False,0,Arc
False,0,Alf
False,1,"REAL ARC's could beat a dozen ARF's with their bare hands. By real, I mean Alpha-class ARC's. The real ones, from Republic Commando. That's one thing I hate about The Clone Wars, they really misrepresented ARC troopers. ""Who wants to be an ARC trooper?"" Well, too bad. You can't. You have to be BORN an ARC trooper. "
False,0,Most likely arc
False,0,Arc
False,0,Dayum so I guess we all gotta get on that new canon now 😑
False,1,"He plays Lor San Tekka, he's not in the original trilogy"
False,1,Swedish actor Max von Sydow. 
False,1,"Could be...but we'll never find out within the movies cos well, Ren kinda decapitated him😁"
False,0,Yea! The actor is familiar too but I think maybe he's in Episode 4 or 5 as one of the rebel generals.
False,1,...and he knew who Ren was
False,1,"I thought the same,  cant put a name to the face though...."
False,0,Star wars is the  best movies  world
False,0,Always was and is lol
False,0,He was told by Yoda that he would be considered a Jedi after he confronted Anakin/Vader.
False,0,I'd say he follows more closely to his fathers steps. 
False,0,I think so yes just because he is like the new version of a Jedi almost I guess.
False,0,"In my opinion, he most definitely was! 1st & foremost it's in his bloodline. A blood line created by the force itself. And since he denied the temptation of the darkside, how much more jedi can you get?!"
False,0,He took the lightsaber and attempted to strike down the emperor just like he wanted so I think his destiny might still be in question
False,0,Yoda said he was ready so he is and he brought down the galatic empire
False,2,"You are talking about Anakin, he's talking about Luke....I think he was a Jedi because he chose his destiny when he denied the emperor and he brought Vader back to the light, which was the mission Obi-wan and Yoda needed him to complete. So he was a Jedi, though not in the traditional sense."
False,0,Well in my opinion he is.Nevertheless  he was too old or married secretly to Padmè in the end he betrayed the emperor and saved his son that shows that throughout the years he had still good in him which leads to the conclusion that he is a Jedi 
False,0,"It is Expanded Universe, it was considered as a lower-tier canon before Kennedy 66'ed the EU."
False,0,"Stop believing these fan theories man, you'll find out soon enough that it's far off."
False,0,Jar Jar is not force sensitive nor is he a darksider
False,0,"Yes, the sith will prevail"
False,0,Yes
False,0,Darth to the core!!!
False,0,I favor your reply
False,0,"Ehhh yeah, jedi turned sith for me"
False,0,Probably....Despite the low blow...(you know what I mean)
False,0,Lol! Was it really good? I can't wait! 👏
False,0,How might I ask?
False,0,You just spoiled it

False,1,Shame it got cancelled :(
False,1,I mean the clones wars tv series is very character developmental
False,0,"What do you mean
"
False,0,"Haha!!! Glad I'm not alone!
"
False,0,I like greedo
False,0,Well after four hours im your first reply. So no no one feels the same besides me😆
False,0,"Probably not. Looks like she was created for an artbook, rather than any sort of storyline."
False,0,"Well, I've seen the film, and all I can say is that its still an unanswered question as to how it made its way from cloud city to where Finn got it"
False,0,I think Lando may be Finns father.
False,0,I had the same thought!
False,0,Why don't you just wait for the film to find out? 
False,0,"I can't explain but that's a really
Good theory! It would and could make a lot of sense. I'm really Hoping its revealed in how the heck anyone got their hands on that specific lightsaber again. Maybe Rey scavenged it like it was on a crashed ship on her planet or something and then she gives it to Finn. I don't know there are many possibilities!"
False,0,"I think it's a sign he could be dark side in the new trilogy, there were a couple other signs in the original movies."
False,1,"It was also used to keep the audience guessing as to whether Luke would turn to the dark side and join Darth Vader, since Force choke was an iconic Vader power by that point."
False,0,"Luke might a have also been dabbling I bathe light and dark side of the force to become more powerful, and after that over a long period of time. Luke might have been swayed by the dark side of the force. I posted this question up recently  and got some awesome feedback. Good Question!!"
False,0,"Adding on to what ^ said, he most likely learned this skill on his own, and doesn't know that it is considered dark side-ish to use certain force powers, he could use force lightning he probably would, but I haven't seen him anytime using lightning but he may have. "
False,2,"Like just doesn't know any better, he was only rained briefly by obi and yoda. It also shows the difference between him and PT Jedi. They were afeared towards using abilities like force choke and in a lot of ways that's why they were destroyed, because of their complacency and lack of progression in their views. Choke is no different than striking down foes with a lightsaber."
False,0,"She was killed by commander Bly on Felucia during order 66... Episode lll, it clearly shows it though.."
False,0,"No, that was before the clone wars, she was killed in 19 BBY on felucia"
False,0,"I don't think she ever did, she was killing during Order 66 by her clone regiment "
False,0,Turn*
False,1,"Basically the whole continuity of Star Wars post Episode 6 and the EU. Books, comics video games, tv shows etc. Disney has now de-canonized the post episode 6 stories"
False,1,"Canon refers to the official storyline of Star Wars. That includes all of the movies, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels, and all books/comics/games beginning on April 25, 2014."
False,0,"Fear leads to anger
Anger leads to hate 
Hate leads to suffering 
All you sith are just to scared to be a man and do what is right and cower under the dark side "
False,0,"              grey Jedi Code

There is no light side nor is there a dark side there is only the force and I will do what I must to keep the balance the balance keeps me together there is no good without evil and the evil must not be allowed to flourish there is passion your emotion sanity yet peace chaos yet order I in the wielder of the flame protector of the balance on the holder of the torch lighting the way and the keeper of the flame soldier of balance I'm a guardian of the balance 

        I am a grey jedi "
False,0,"While the Jedi are more in the right than the Sith, their arrogance can get the best of them sometimes. To quote Sergeant Kal again, ""he seems to want respect from me just because he can open jars of caf with his mind."""
False,0,"I think both faction are foolish like kal skirata says ""my decapitations are more righteous then your decapitations"". The jedi always think of that they are the good guy and thinks people look up to them but most people are afraid of jedi and rightfully so. They get free passes to do what they want and just say its for everyones good. The sith are foolish because in their quest to get power they in fight and kill each other of making it easier for the jedi to defeat them. Revan is one of the few tbat understands this "
False,0,The force exists anyway. Many in the galaxy don't even believe its real. If the one could not survive without the other then only force sensitive beings could survive.
False,0,I feel it's more of a mutual using of the force and force users a symbiotic relationship one could not survive without the other be it Jedi or Sith 
False,0,"Yeah. But the Sith need to remember that the Force commands them, not the other way around."
False,0,"I messed my code up and skipped two lines lol, sorry, but you know what I'm talking about "
False,0,"Jedi believe they are the righteous path. Sith believe there is no right and wrong only action and reaction. No one will know who is right until the end of everything. When no life stands in the galaxy, when no time flows, when the force stands still in the galaxy because the galaxy is dead. Only then when every life is one with the force in the nether realm of the force will the question be answered.... Is there dark and light? Or are the shades of the same hue?"
False,0,"Whoops, I meant soldier of balance not protector, my bad! "
False,0,Hahahaha good one man
False,1,"Two and a Half Men parody....Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul"
False,0,I heard a rumor that they might do one... Don't know if I'm read that here or the Disney wiki.
False,0,I think a romantic comedy on corasaunt 
False,0,after choking down the prequels I'd be pretty much ok with anything at this point
False,1,"It would be amazing, especially if it set during the old republic era"
False,0,I was thinking maybe make about the old republic era since they're doing a movie trilogy taking place after the original trilogy. I think following the story of revan would be really interesting
False,2,I would enjoy it....i would totally try as hard as i could to be in it too
False,0,"There was speculation that she could be Barriss Offee, but it's doubtful. She is probably a brand new character unique to Rebels."
False,0,sooooo the inquisitors will be in TFA as the knights of ren lel. or the council of 9 which is how many inquisitors there is but that's another discussion. bottom line. the inquisitors will be in TFA or the next movie 
False,0,Perhaps barris offee 
False,0,"I don't think she's from any of the movies previously, I don't remember her even been mentioned before I read about it on here "

False,0,3 hours for me!! 😀😀😀😁

False,0,Lol New Mexico is like Tatooine by far...i goy family there and when i was there i got burnt so bad my back was purple
False,0,Try New Mexico 
False,0,"NeverForget501st...its true....the heat...the cold....all of it

False,0,Same here. But I have no idea how long it will be for me.
False,0,Good luck friend....may the force be with you
False,0,"Good luck, you'll need it."
False,0,Good luck 
False,0,"Lmao. Anakin got his Dark side built During the clone wars, a subconscious building of hate"
False,0,Luke was trained for 2
False,0,Episode 3 anakin hes actually trained for sonething like 10 years like was trained for like 2
False,0,"They will, either separately or make a new complete collection"
False,0,"Ehhh, they will probs wait until Episode 9 is out"
False,1,"Probably, but ep9 doesn't come out until 2019"
False,0,Probably in 2016 june
False,0,"Yea i love the quirky approach to the series that the games make
"
False,1,Yes I hope they do. I really enjoyed all Lego star wars games thus far.
False,0,"It's unlikely that any Clone Wars era will be in this version, maybe in the next or one after that 

As for the characters, I'm not that big on adding the bounty hunters (unless they made it so you could play  either side), but adding the likes of Tarkin (using the Tarkin novel for skill sets), Veers (AT-AT commander), and even Piet could be interesting 

I'm pretty sure Chewie and Lando will be in, but Wedge would make a great inclusion

Might I also add that adding Ewoks, which you could kill, would remove much frustration from this game "
False,0,Different Han skins would be cool
False,0,"Dice already said that Battlefront was going to be Empire-Era only, so any Republic-Era characters will not be implemented. That doesn't however mean that they can't be in the next one, if there is a next game."
False,0,"I really wish instant action was in the new Battlefront. In fact I wish they would have kept it about the same as the other two, but with the addition of the multiplayer."
False,0,Yoda! The best Jedi ever! Should have been on before Lei!😑
False,0,"Obi wan or Yoda would be neat or chewey
"
False,0,"Those bounty hunters need to show their reasons for getting hired. If Darth Vader hired them, they have to be pretty good. What better way to show this than in star wars battlefront. "
False,0,I want a better game
False,0,"Pretty sure Chewwy is being added as a hero. I think they should add in Denger, IG-88 etc aswell for the empire."
False,0,I think it would be a good idea if they made powerups compatable with heroes and villains  for exampke if han picked Up any starfighter he would be put in the millennium falcon like in fighter squadron but all in one game mode 
False,0,I'm getting sick of this stupid jar jar theory 
False,0,Jar jar is not a sith he is a goofball
False,0,"r2-d2 a sith, it is a droid..."
False,0,Smh
False,0,What if Snoke was Artoo? 
False,0,"Prequels did overuse CGI, but were entirely more action packed with more serious fighting. But I have to say the romance of Anakin and Padme was excruciating to watch (boooring). But that scene in attack of the clones with all those jedi, that was epic"
False,0,i see what you're saying-- i'm trying to get into it. It's all interesting--maybe just not my favorite!
False,0,"I grew up watching prequels first, and they are rated ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (four stars) in my book. However, they relied to heavily on special effects."
False,0,"A quote from the prequels and i dont think that the prequels are bad at all, some of us actually grew up watching Star Wars in chronological order"
False,0,I dont believe that....and your starting to sound like a seperatist
False,0,"Like, they're interesting, 'watchable,' and I'll admit the Jedi fight scenes are way better... but the movies are just terrible. As I sit here trying to re-watch them all, I'm like, waiting for them to end... the characters seem so shallow, and the visuals and CGI are total overkill......"
False,1,"The new Marvel run on Star Wars is brilliant, log on to Comic shop locacter to find a shop near you, I think it covers most countries"
False,0,It depends most comics have diffrent story arcs so it really just depends what era you like
False,0,"I've been wondering the same thing, to no evale.
Darth Maul son of dathimor I read online. Comic book stores in my area are bad at keeping up to date"
False,0,Your right
False,0,"If I'm not mistaken I believe the same was done for VI ROTJ under the name ""Blue Harvest"". Correct me if I'm wrong...."
False,0,I love jango  he is  a beast 
False,0,In my opinion its Jango all the way! Though he did die he still trained Boba and git his life started. IG-88 is certainly great too
False,0,"There are a LOT of Legends characters that need a movie. Oh, well…"
False,0,Ik

False,0,My favorite Jedi is Anakin Luke leia  all the solo kids all the Skywalkers  Tahiri ahsoka Yoda Mace Windu everyone on the council all the younglings all the Padawans all the Jedi Knights all the Jedi Masters  and all the Jedi Grand Masters Tahiri is cool and all the girl jedis I like all the good guys
False,0,All the people who only know the movies will say Anakin yoda or obi. I'm going to say plo and Ashoka
False,0,K'Kruhk or Obi Wan
False,0,"Obi wan kenobi, saetle shan, Revan , Mara jade skywalker, Bardan jusik he turns into a mandolorian force user so he kinda doesn't count but he was a jedi"
False,0,"Ahsoka, Shaak Ti and Obi-Wan (particularly ROTS kenobi) are my favs."
False,0,Ikrit is the best xD
False,0,Luke Skywalker (knight)  and Obi Wan (master)
False,0,I like yoda and honestly am a pretty big fan of kit fisto
False,0,"He was actually learning how to use the force as soon as Qui-Gon died in Phantom Menace, he was a padawan all those years and became a knight at the beginning of the clone wars"
False,0,Unfortunately his true destiny was ruined by the wars 
False,0,Yeah but when anikan was learning the force it was in the clone wars 
False,0,*fates damn auto correct 
False,0,Dual of dates
False,0,"Duel of fates, battle of heros, are teo of the most iconic movie scores

False,0,The soundtrack to the Astroid Chase scene in Empire is my personal favorite. The sequence provides an epic bridge between the Imperial March and the Love Theme...
False,0,"Duel of the fates, Cantina band 2 and Panaka and the queens protectors! "
False,0,The main theme and the imperial march
False,0,"Binary Sunset theme, Anakin's Dream from Episode 3, Across the Stars (Anakin and Padmé love theme), Han Solo and Princess Leia love theme....or Imperial March"
False,0,So get tickets and don't spoil it for yourself
False,0,"I totally agree, so Im not tempted to look at spoilers "
False,0,Ill be there at midnight 
False,0,I am not looking at anything till i see the movie
False,1,You don't have to visit them.
False,0,"Like I said, don't know my opinion. But I do think he's an amazing and humerus character lol! He was necessary for the story. "
False,0,Finally someone sees it my way. JarJar is necessary!
False,0,Still...the point of my comment was that Anakin Skywalker wouldnt have been freed or met Padmé
False,0,"If Jar Jar didn't exist, Qui Gon would probably still be alive. Lost in the jungles of Naboo, looking for Thebs, but alive"
False,0,If Jar Jar didnt exist tho he would not have saved Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan from getting hit my that CIS tank...so they wouldnt have gone to Tatooine and Anakin wouldnt have been discovered....he wouldnt have become a jedi or met Padmé....no Luke and Leia....soooo Jar Jar was kinda vital to the course of history
False,0,Jar jar sucks. Visually & character wise
False,0,"He got medal in the EU, in old Marvel comics."

False,0,*Chewie.* stupid auto correct.

False,0,he's just a walking carpet.
False,0,He does get a medal. Read the Canon novels
False,0,Lol :) was always thinking about this. Poor chewie. Let's hope he gets one this time. 'Medal for Chewie' campaign!! 😄
False,0,I agree with space racism 
False,0,"They both had the intention of training Luke, and probably both knew the would want to kill each other over him."
False,1,"Yip, Luke was meant to replace Vader, and he knew that but Darth was such a huge slave to the dark side that he was willing to embrace it, but then he opened his eyes"
False,0,I didn't think the rule of two ended. I thought sidious was pitting Luke and Vader against each other to take the more powerful as his apprentice
False,0,"Sidious saw Luke as Vader's replacement...he knew Vader was Broken...and due to his body being mostly cybernetics he was significantly less powerful....he couldnt achieve force lightning or much else....soooo...he was scouting for a new apprentice for himself, not Vader."
False,0,"Could you elaborate a little on how/when the rule of two ended? As far as I can tell, Sidious had one master, Plagueis. And as master himself, also had exclusively only one apprentice at a time: Maul, Dooku, and Vader. Who was an example of a Sith henchman?"
False,0,I agree. It was a recap of Dooku's death.
False,4,"Sidious saw the endgame and knew that Luke wouldn't be Vaders apprentice, but his replacement"
False,0,"Sidious ended the rule of two and made the rule of one, there were many ""minions"" that Sidious had with Vader being his right hand man, Luke would be a high ""henchman"""

False,0,Wellll...im only 18 and i know mostly everything...Star Wars is life....soooo....maybe a few yeard if you are passionate enough

False,1,If you wanna learn it all probably 82 years
False,0,"Yes. When a Tusken tribe becomes too small, they'll occasionally abduct human settlers and force them to become one of them. "
False,0,I guess they incorporated humans into their ranks?
False,1,"Neither. They're their own species of sentient but somewhat primitive beings. They called them beasts in the movies more in the way European settlers called Native Americans ""savages,"" more out of misunderstanding than anything. "
False,0,"Ok, What if at the end of the Wars Trek crossover, that Snoke was actually JJ Abrams and not Captain Kirk, and the plan was to fuel the fire all along. "
False,0,"That would not end the fued, only add to it."
False,0,"Yes, that's a good way to measure it out. "
False,0,"On a scale of 1 to ten (one being good), most Jedi are 1or 2 but Anakin was like 7or 8.
On the other hand most With are 9 or 10, but Vader was 8 or 9.
Compared this way, Vader was better than Anakin."
False,1,I disagree anakin makes childish decisions and blames his failures on everyone else. The movies made anakin inti a child who refused to take direction. Clone wars 2008 is the only good way they potray anakin
False,0,I totally agree!
False,2,"I like it. He grew up. But also he has his children to deal with, I don't think he could kill Luke or Leia because he still has some Jedi in him. (Sith stress darkness from the start). Vader sees his children and can't kill them, maybe he also sees padme in them also"

False,0,"The season pass is $80. Roughly $20 per pack, with those other extra things"
False,0,He's talking about the Season Pass in general. There is currently no new dlc aside from the Jakku map.
False,0,Is there a new DLC? 
False,0,"Although the price seems about $20.00 too high for me, I still payed for it, considering that there will be more content in the dlc than there already is in the game."
False,0,Not yet anyway. Possibly in one of the four future expansion packs
False,0,I don't think so
False,1,"I read something where Lloyd was saying Star Wars ruined his childhood because people felt like he didn't portray Anikin well and he was teased for it I agree though, it was a difficult act to live up to people's expectations and maybe young Lloyd lacked direction during filming."
False,1,"Yes, he did well, especially for his age. Lucas needed a much better script, but the kid did what he was directed to do. 👏"
False,1,"i think he did brilliantly considering how young he was and how it was such a huge role, respect. "
False,3,He did what he was directed to do. With better direction we'd see a definite improvement in acting. 
False,1,Leave the kid alone. He was just a kid. It's all in the hand of the casting and direction.
False,3,"I mean he was just a kid, I still cringe at his lines but we should give him a break. It was more poor direction from Lucas than anything else "
False,0,The forces premonition of danger and spidey senses are pretty much the same. They just tell you something bad is gonna Halen not what will amd the fact that darth maul can force choke fools.
False,0,"Yeah the power of the force is incredible. Darth Vader in 4, 5 and 6 is choking people half way across his ship Like Star Wars beats everything "

False,0,"Possible that they have had a past, but I think stormtroopers and other Imp officers were responsible for their deaths. It would be in interesting thing to look in on with their past though"
False,0,"Plagieus hates essence transfer. He wanted to live forever in his own body, not even a clones. If he is snoke it is because he survived Sidious' ambush and went underground. He knew Sidious would fail because he had a vision of Vader killing the emperor. He wanted to kill the child anakin Sidious wanted to train him. Plagieus warned Sidious ""sith stress darkness from the start"" no Jedi conversions. That is what killed Sidious. I bet snoke is plagieus."

False,0,Yeah

False,0,"There are white, Orange, blue, green, purple, Black, yellow, Brown (1 Brown lightsaber ever, from a wookie), Black (also 1 in the universe, called darksaber), grey, silver, gold and many others. 

Light saber types: normal saber, short practice saber, lightwhip, huge saber, baton saber, Light pike, double and spinning. 
One more but i forget the name"
False,0,Star wars rebels ahsoka has the white sabers.  Never seen those before
False,0,In the Knights of the old republic games there's all kinds of colors you can make your lightsaber
False,0,Because each color represents a character trait or style. Every character trait or style fits into one of the existing ones already
False,1,Cad Bane was designed to be an absolute equal match for a jedi. The tubes on his face are to survive a force choke for example
False,0,I would agree with cad bane he is a criminal mastermind

False,1,"Thanks Rex, embo has to be one of my favorite bounty hunters"
False,0,"And he was going to die in the episode Bounty Hunters, but they liked the character so much that they killed one of the other bounty hunters instead"

After that, Embo was still alive"
False,0,Well its pretty hard but Luke would win in the comics Luke had to go across the galaxy to be trained by many people become a Jedi also he went down for short. . to the dark side so in my opinion Luke has more experience and would win
False,0,To answer that question look that up on YouTube u should come across multiple versus videos breaking it down.
False,0,"Luke's a jedi and he can force choke anyway(episode VI and EU), Anakin's emotions would be his downfall."
False,0,Anakin! The dark side was melting hatred out of him you can see it in his combat. I don't think anyone could be him then. He made a bad mistake by attacking up hill. 
False,0,Anakin Skywalker by far
False,0,Probably Anakin. 👍🏼
False,0,Depends on the playing field. During the mustafar duel Anakin was more powerful but the circumstances favored obi. So depends but on a completely even playing field id say Anakin 
False,0,I think so as well but like you said it would be close 
False,1,"It would be very close, but I think Anakin would prevail."
False,0,You can already look at pictures of snoke and h they look diffrent
False,0,"Sidious did kill plagieus. But plagieus could keep others from dying, Sidious said he couldn't save himself. But maybe Sidious was tricked and plagieus survived."
False,0,"I believe the exact quote from palpatine was "" I defeated my master "" not a clear answer he could have killed him but I think he continues to lurk in the shadows "
False,0,And That Plaguies was practicing was to cheat death
False,0,Or that his 'apprentice' killed him rather. He didn't reveal that it was him that killed him.
False,0,"It's possible, considering they never actually /showed/ the death of Plagueis in the movies. Although I kinda doubt it because Palpatine told Anakin that he killed him."
False,0,Yes but what if Palatine didn't actually kill him 
False,0,"Unlikely. Palpatine said He died by his apprecntice, which in the former EU, was Palpatine himself, so I don't think he was lying."
False,0,"K thanks

False,0,"Perhaps, the bount hunters need a stand alone film in the near future. Maybe a race for a bounty for a large reward by the empire or the hurts. I'd love to see that. Maybe that could be called ""Fett"" and Boba Fett would be the main focus and he could be competing with the others to capture someone or something of importance."
False,0,"If we're looking at it from an action-scene standpoint, I wouldn't disagree with you (even though I am in no way dissatisfied with the action scenes in the original movies). However, if we're looking at it in terms of plot, I would tend to disagree. I personally don't believe that the bounty hunters are necessary in developing the plot and themes of the story, as they only serve to drive the plot for a short while. The added pressure of bounty hunters on our heroes would be rather unneeded in terms of the actual story."

False,0,I ignore these shows and can live without it. RC books and comic series Republic and Dark Times are way better.
False,1,"They are an integral part of the Star Wars universe and great shows in their own right, so yeah, watch them. I would, however, recommend looking up the chronological order for The Clone Wars, as some episodes were aired out of chronological order."
False,1,It keeps getting better
False,0,Watched the movie and first episode. Very impressed I am 
False,1,"The Hidden enemy. The movie is still the pilot. However The Hidden enemy, and season 2s Cat and Mouse, take place before the events of the movie. The clone wars in an anthology, the episodes aren't in chronological order. But the pilot movie is the introduction into TCW and the new characters like Rex, Ahsoka and Ventress, and how they interact with the old and new"
False,1,"Rex, The Clone Wars movie is not actually the pilot. There is an episode I've seen on the Season 1 DVD (for some reason I think they're out of order) that is basically the episode right before the movie. It's basically how a traitor in the clone unit on Christophsis allowed the Separatist armies to land almost undetected. Which then leads into the invasion of Christophsis."
False,1,Definitely recommend it! They're great.
False,1,Clone wars is good haven't started Rebels yet 
False,1,"I thought TCW was excellent for the first four seasons, five is okay, and I didn't really like six. As for Rebels, I liked the first few episodes okay, but not well enough to stick with it. I have seen a few of the later ones though, and I don't care for them. "
False,4,"The clone wars may have been only a little average during its first few episodes, but it kept getting better and better, diving into new world's and familer characters from the Expanded universe like Mortis or Quinlan Vos. With the odd cameo of original trilogy characters like Bossk or Tarkin.

If you enjoyed the series after it's 6th season, there are other materials that tell other stories that were in the future of the series and still considered canon. Darth Maul Son of Dathimor comic, Crystal Crisis on Utapu reel, The Bad Batch reel, and the Dark Disciple novel. 

As for Rebels, it is fairly the same, the first half of season 1 was fairly non eventful, but the mid season finale reason sucked me in with 3 words, To Be and Continued. After that, the series has also gone from strength to strength, with the odd filler episode but overall, I watch it on a regular basis. 

One more comment about Rebels, due to some story points in Rebels, I suggest watching The Clone Wars first, before starting Rebels. 

There is also a Clone Wars movie that is the pilot to the series. So it's best to start there. "

False,0,Separated at birth? Idk I'll have to get back to the guy who sent me the info.
False,0,"Didn't Han explain to Rey that the story was true about the Jedi and the force? If so,wouldn't Rey already know the truth if she was Hans and Leias daughter?"
False,0,Somebody in that movie is somebody's kids or kids. I'm really leaning towards it being Rey. 
False,0,I heard this from a person on set of Star Wars Force Awakens! Now do u believe?
False,0,"It really depends on the era. As a general rule, the Post-Rusaan Jedi Order forbade marriage. However, before the Reformations, policy on marriage fluctuated, and it was often allowed. Luke New Jedi Order is perfectly fine with it. "
False,0,I just think Anakin should have gotten expelled from the order
False,0,"Nobody knew that Anakin and Padmé were a thing, and nobody saw them kiss ever. Even so, having feelings for someone is not grounds for being expelled from the Jedi Order; the Jedi realize that feelings are a part of life. However, Anakin marrying Padmé and keeping the relationship secret would have gotten him expelled, since a Jedi is supposed to hold the Order and the Force above all else. With the excepting of Ki-Adi-Mundi and another Jedi whose name escapes me (their species had a low birth rate, therefore they were permitted by the Council to marry and have children), marriage was forbidden by the Council and the Jedi.

False,0,He was shown in the Clone Wars series as being alive. Sidious kidnapped him and said that he had uses for him but it is never revealed what happens to him after that
False,0,"His final fate is still unknown. But I'd imagine that he'd be dead by TFA. It's possible that maybe, some time before the battle of yavin, all of the inquistors went after him to kill him, only one came back after killing him but later died of his injuries. That would explain how there are no inquistors in the original trilogy, and why they were never hunting Luke"
False,0,Yeah 
False,0,Probably dead.
False,0,"50-50 chance because in star wars the clone wars he was alive but he might've been killed by obi one or die of old age

False,0,Interesting to note that Leia is crying in the trailer. Something pretty tragic had to happened.
False,1,^ Marvel just released a new comic about Leia immediately following the events in IV and it addresses her feelings about the loss. I highly recommend it. 
False,0,She cared about her home world but she was loyal to the cause and gave a great sacrifice.
False,0,"probably because she doesn't wanna look suspicious in  front of Darth Vader and make him think that he shouldn't have done that. 

Of course, she doesn't that he doesn't give a damn about that because he can sense what Leia is thinking."
False,0,"Obi wan would go full blood thirsty again Maul, Savage, and anyone else he saw responsible for the death of Satine. Including the Jedi who would have prevented them from being together when they first met."
False,0,"First comment...Anakin wouldnt have died, it was his anger that made him unaware of his surroundings.....i actually believe Padmé would have lived, Anakin wouldnt have ""killed her in his anger"" and Obi-Wan would have died....Anakin would have went on to kill Sidious....soooo...he probs would have trained his children elsewhere"
False,0,"Ob1 got a ""taste""of the dark side when he fought against Darth Maul. He let his anger get away from himself. If he would haven turned to the dark side he may have been powerful,but not as much as dooku."
False,0,"then probably Anakin would be DEAD because in episode III
Obiwan beat Anakin.
"
False,0,"I think it all boils down to the greatness of invention, discovery & creation. Stop bitching Lucas. He created something he loved which grew & became larger then life. This is the reality of life."
False,1,"Disney's really screwed things up though, I mean the existing canon was really great"
False,0,"Money was absolutely a thing for George Lucas. He built a merchandising empire, and much of the worldbuilding he did, especially in the prequels, was based around that. He's explicitly compared himself to Darth Vader in the sense that he became the very thing he wanted to end. Lucas wanted to end what he saw as a bad studio system, and then he ended up becoming the head of a major studio.

I think people look at Lucas' motives with rose-colored glasses to justify being annoyed at Disney for all of the movies they're making, and especially for de-canonizing the Expanded Universe. But that ignores the fact that it was Lucas' idea to do the sequel trilogy, Lucas came up with the idea of the Anthology films, and Lucas ignored the EU whenever it suited him.

The only major difference between Lucasfilm under Lucas and Lucasfilm under Disney is the amount of film content we're getting. Their motives aren't really all that different. Both have really great motives for wanting to bring people great stories, and both had a vested financial interest in doing so."
False,0,*mega hit
False,0,"True, but he set it all in motion and was also involved in the expanding of the universe because of this mega he created"
False,2,"No, I have to disagree with you there. Lucas didn't create the universe. He created a single story. The EU created a universe. "
False,0,"Yeah....but money was never really a thing for George Lucas, he created a whole mythology, a whole world....because he loved to tell stories. The money just came with it. We must thank him for his dedication, afterall, many don't know that he had troubles when making Empire strikes back...but he was so determined to get it done he paid for the whole making of the movie....subsequently making him broke"

False,0,That's a pretty hefty task. What do you want to know?

False,0,um what
False,0,Wow what if
False,0,Same
False,0,"Out of Skywalker or Solo, I'm leaning more towards Skywalker than solo"
False,0,That stick she has I think turns into  a light saber
False,0,I'm not so sure Finn is force sensitive but I guess we will see in a few days 
False,0,Bet she is Luke's son
False,0,"I think so too! She is the main character of the film, so she's presumably the hero with the great Jedi destiny."
False,0,she does have force sensitivity and so does Finn. they both are js. also we will be seeing another double bladed lightsaber 
False,0,We will never have the iconic Darth Vader!
False,0,Then Anikan wouldn't have completed the prophecy because Darth Vader made it that there would be only  2 Jedi /Sith for each side of the force Darth Vader and Darth sidious for dark and yoda and Luke for the light so there was a balance
False,0,That was the prophecy 
False,0,"No, by anikin turning to the dark side then killling sideous and dying on the light side thanks to luke, forfilled the prophecy bucause with him dying so did the empire, bringing balance to the force as the prophecy sais."
False,0,Order 66 probably would've happened I guess 
False,0,The prophecy would have then come completely true and Palpatine would have been either killed or imprisoned and Mace and all of the jedi wouldve survived....but would order 66 have happened anyway?
False,0,The original 3 wouldn't of happened and Luke wouldn't join the sith....
False,0,Bad parenting perhaps? 
False,0,That would be interesting to find out but how did Lando let his son fall to the First Order?
False,0,"A toy sold on Amazon labels Finn as Lando's son, but we'll have to wait until the movie to see if that was a mistake or not."
False,0,Anything is possible
False,1,"No but certain elements of the game has become canon, such as HK-47, Lehon/Rakata Prime and the planet Taris"
False,1,The Knights of the old Republic is not cannon. But the old Republic government which preceded the galactic Republic is cannon. So there may be some new cannon story's coming out dealing with that era.
False,1,"No, but there's no reason entity c couldn't be."
False,0,No
False,0,"...Not my favourite either, but I feel he is an important part of the story, afterall he did blow up the second death star"
False,0,Could Fin be his son?
False,0,"He's made some appearances yet most ppl don't rally care of lando...he allrighy to me...not my favorite tho
"
False,0,"I don't know were a saw, but it's looks like he'll be in episode VIII"
False,0,"Ah, cool thanks, they can't leave him out"
False,0,"He's made a few appearances in Star Wars Rebels (voiced by Billy Dee Williams), and there's been hints that he could appear in Episode VIII."
False,0,......He should be in Force Awakens
False,0,My theory for that episode is that maul gave them all new guns. When the Pirates enter the ship and open a case we see a bunch of guns in the case. I think maul gave them new guns. 
False,0,"I think she is talking about the blasters man, and i have noticed the blaster bolts are different colors as well"
False,0,"About that...it still doesn't matter they just recirpeve crystals that r different colors Jedi prefer blue green purple and with prefer red usually but they could use whatever color they want...
"
False,1,"Of course, but in the Clone Wars when Darth Maul and Savage uses Hondo's own pirates against them, Maul's side is red and Hondo's side goes blue."
False,2,"It actually has nothing to do with that. So basically, different types of blasters fire different colored bolts, depending on what propellent gas they use. Red bolts are by far the most common in the galaxy. Blue bolts are blaster energy infused with small amount of ionized plasma, making them slightly more effective against droids; that's why they're GAR standard issue. Other colors tend to be used only rarely. "

False,0,Me personally I think that title Run is either the clone of Anakin Skywalker or Ben Skywalker aka Luke's son

True,0,Ur mom
False,0,Yeah ^^ when George Lucas first created star wars he didn't create all the back stories until making empire.  Then he made Vader Luke's father 
False,0,Because he was not ready to know the truth
False,0,Because George Lucas had not thought of that.
False,0,Because he wanted Vader and the emperor dead and if Luke knew this he would be unable to kill his father which he wasn't in the end
False,0,"Vader is not his father, Anakin Skywalker was, but he died with the birth of Vader"

False,0,Thank you guys. Both the idea that the electrical energy would short circuit his system and the fact that he no longer possesses any flesh and blood arms are interesting points. They both make sense. Much appreciated.

False,0,"He had the ability before he became the half man half machine, but we never saw it on screen, dig into the old episode 3 video game and some comics"

Be careful Drath Bane is canon, or at least is existence is, they have to tell that story in a Canon form, and I don't think it would do as good if it was just a novel.

False,1,Revan is my favorite jedi/sith ever especially after being reborn he is super boss so I would love a series on the old Republic 
False,0,What about revan!!
False,0,It's nice to see the star wars story from the point of view of someone who comes from a planet that believes in the empire. It has always been from the point of view of those who were raised to fear the empire. 
False,0,The first stormtroopers were clones because they were clone troopers from order 66 but then the empire started training imperial cadets instead 
False,0,There have been force sensitive clones
False,0,Drafted in the empire the soldiers are trained from brith and there are no clones in the empire at this point in time
False,0,Okay thank you
False,0,no he is a human who was drafted. he has been training since he was a very young child tho that's why he says his whole life. but he is not a clone 
False,0,It requires high maintenance. 
False,0,He won it from lando calrissian in a game of sabacc (gambling) on tatooine 
False,0,It's a Correllian YT 1300 Freighter with a lot of (mostly illegal) modifications.
False,0,"Between Han and the Falcon's previous owners, the Falcon has become one of the most heavily modified starships in the galaxy, with military-grade weapons, shields, and armor, incredibly advanced hyperdrive and sensor suite, and the sublight maneuverability and speed of a starfighter. "
False,0,"no, the millenium falcon was a YT-1300 light freighter, not uncommon to see but not in abundance either"
False,0,"No, it's a heavily modified Correllian Engineering Corporation YT-1300 light freighter. At one point the YT-1300's were one of the most common ships of its role in the galaxy, but by the time of the Thrawn Trilogy, most had either been destroyed or scrapped, and were somewhat rare. "
False,0,no it is a corellian transport ship there are some more but not alot. hans ship had been modified and outfitted with more things tho 
False,0,"I think it was the first and last of its kind, built especially to suit smuggling"
False,0,Going back to previous answers a curved hilt does not necessarily mean the wielder uses form two (mikashi) it is a hilt that focuses on precision.
False,0,"Personal preference and I suppose he didnt want to conform, plus it looks cooler. Afterall, he is arguably the best swordsman by definition"
False,0,Its preference 
False,1,The curved hilt catered to Dooku's  preferred  lightsaber combat style called makashi. Nothing to do with style or elegance but the extra angles and leverage the curve hilt provides. Strictly strategy 
False,0,It allows him to perform form 2 lightsaber combat more easily 
False,0,Preference. Every lightsaber is made for the wielded specifically 
False,0,he chose the curved lightsaber handle because it showed the elegance of lightsaber combat 
False,0,All lightsabers are different. They are (mostly) made by the user to become a Jedi.

False,0,"There was a scene in the original Clone Wars Tv show, that hinted when they had it. Can't remember what season or chapter."
False,0,And how the hell did she get pregnant in the first place... I mean Anakin was gone a long time for the war
False,0,She wore heavy clothing to disguise the pregnancy. That happens in the real world sometimes too.
False,0,She says that she is fat and needs to go on a diet? It's a good way to cover up but idk 
False,0,I thought it was hilarious that she only appeared pregnant after she was taken from Mustafar
False,0,They didn't kno Anakin was the father they thought it was someoneelse
False,0,I think she hides it pretty well but some people like obi wan figure it out 
False,0,"Thank you. The only stormtroopers who ever hit anyone were Darth Vaders ones that boarded the Tantive 4. And his legion are clones, not recruits. Hence they hit someone. "
False,0,P-Nelly....hahaha....no the first guy was serious...stormtroopers have terrible aim
False,0,"If they are cornered and unarmed probably considerable damage, unless they get some tips from Darth Vader on how to block blaster fire with your hands"

False,0, they should not kill Luke off or make him turn to the dark side I know that one point he turned to the dark side
False,0,Luke is evil
False,0,I hope that Like loses his connection to the Force and has a personal crisis
False,0,"Guess we'll find out soon, the premiere upon us"
False,0,Maybe he gets killed by the Knights of Ren at the start. And R2 only just manages to escape
False,0,It is possible that Luke has a connection with this Kylo Ren character
False,0,"It was a big deal when The mysterious bad ass Darth Vader had announced he was his father and then revealed his face (which is less relevant). The Internet.... No the box office will break if Luke announces something like that.... Maybe dealing with Kylo Ryn? ""Kylo Ryn I am your Father!"" Would be insane!"
False,0,"I think it's to be the big question of the movie.
Where is he? Why he's ""hiding""?
That sort of thing"
False,0,And cheer your lungs out when the big star wars logo appears after that deafening silence
True,0,U should atleast wear pants. They don't like it when you show up naked. Not that I would know that.

False,0,I would cosplay. I mean it hy not? It's a once in a lifetime thing! Envoy!

False,0,That scene with Chewbacca ' s dad. 
False,0,Felt like it promoted drugs. 
False,0,Never seen it. It's impossible to find.
False,0,What is now called Legends is what used to be considered canonical.  
False,1,"Actually Legends is its own canon and separate from the established story and is a universe in its own right, hence the name legends. Although elements of the legends universe may be brought into the canon/main universe/ story of Star Wars."
False,1,"The simple version is that Canon takes place in the same universe as the movies. While Legends ,today, is more closer to fan fiction than official stories. 

I'm not dissing Legends, I love some of them. 

But in all fairness, if there is nothing that is contradictory to it in canon, there is no excuse that a legends event or story didn't happen. "
False,0,And then he was blown to hell
False,0,"Bail became a senator of alderman in the empirial Senate, while secretly working for the rebellion"

False,0,I do not think that Luke is Kyle ran  I know at some point he turned to the dark side I don't know if it's on the movie or not
False,0,"Lukes not seen in the trailers to create intrigue,  it's clearly working "
False,0,But I agree he isn't Kylo Ren
False,0,"I think Luke will be a part of the dark side, simply because JJ Abrams did not include him in any trailers or posters or anything. But we know he is in the movie, because Mark Hamill is one of the stars of the movies. Why put a mystery around a character who's the same as the last time we saw him?"
False,0,"There is about a 30 year gap in the visual timeline some the man with the bionic hand could very well be someone else, I think it's Luke and if I'm right that means Kylo Ren most like can't be Luke there is a chance Luke can be playing both sides kind of like palpatine did, but I don't think so, I think Kylo Ren is Han Solo's son this makes sense because Luke did hunt Han's son during this time gab revealing that Han's son went dark"
False,0,Ezra Bridger is Kylo Ren lol
False,0,How about Solo's offspring? 
False,0,I think since u posted this there's been more Kylo=Luke post
False,0,That is a more likely theory

False,0,"I think he is you can kinda tell by the way he uses his lightsaber against the clone and kylo ren.

False,0,Yes. My theory is his force-sensitivity is what triggered his dissent from the New Order (I'm sorry I don't think that's what it's called).

""Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?""
―Lama Su, to Obi-Wan Kenobi[src]
Sifo-Dyas was a human male Jedi Master who commissioned the Kaminoans' creation of the Grand Army of the Republic over a decade before the Clone Wars. A Jedi from the Cassandran Worlds, Sifo-Dyas was gifted with the power of foresight, and he earned a seat on the Jedi High Council prior to the Invasion of Naboo. When he foresaw a coming war that would ravage the galaxy, he believed that the Galactic Republic would require an army if it were to prevail. Yet, his peers on the Jedi Council rejected his notions, leading to his removal from the Council. Nevertheless, he pursued his ideas in secret and contacted the Kaminoan cloners, purporting to have the authorization of the Council and the Galactic Senate to raise an army for the Republic. In doing so, he unknowingly entered the crosshairs of the Sith, who set out to assume control of his cloning project.

Around the time of the Invasion of Naboo, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum requested Sifo-Dyas conduct clandestine negotiations with the Pyke Syndicate, and he headed for Oba Diah with Valorum's personal aide, Silman. However, the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus hired the Pykes to target Sifo-Dyas's T-6 shuttle, and they shot down his ship over the Oba Diah moon. Sifo-Dyas died in the resulting crash, but Silman survived and was taken prisoner by the Pykes, who delivered Sifo-Dyas's body to Tyranus. Consequently, Tyranus and his Sith Master, Darth Sidious, funded Sifo-Dyas's army of clone troopers and manipulated the Jedi Order into taking command of the army when the Clone Wars erupted. It was not until years later that the Jedi began to unravel the Sith's conspiracy and unearthed the details of Sifo-Dyas's demise."
False,0,"I would think that wasCount Dooku under the False name of ""Pyfards"" (MUST BE wrong spelling) to order the creation of the Grand Army."
False,0,One of dooku's minions perhaps?
False,0,"It was Sifo-Dyas during the SC era, he acted without the Republic or Jedi knowing."

False,0,Not fact but Jar Jar may have originally been planned as the daddy of all sith at the time. Like Palpatine's boss big.

False,0,"Well said everyone....further, Lucas wanted solo to be like John Wayne with a strong cowboy like moral code in which case he wud never fire first...I didn't like the change at first until I read his explanation "
False,0,"George Lucas didn't want Han Solo to look like a murderous thug, he wanted him to be the space cowboy/ smuggler he planned. If you watch the special features on some of the movies he explains why he's changed it a few times."
False,0,"Cheers buddy, really appreciate your thorough explanations"
False,1,"In the original version of Episode VI, Greedo never fired a shot. Han shot him before Greedo could make a move. In the 1997 special edition, George Lucas changed it so that Greedo shot just before Han did. In the 2004 DVD, he tweaked it further so they fired at the same time. In both cases, Greedo missed.

There are fans who don't like that change because they feel it changed Han's character, and because of the way the scene is portrayed (with Greedo missing from only a few feet away)."

False,0,This post gave me aids
False,0,"And I heard that the earth was flat, or that the moon was made of cheese, or that Revenge of the sith was the final movie, doesn't mean it is"
False,0,I don't think it's fair to rule out that Kylo Ren could be Han Solo's son 
False,0,I have a feeling Kylo Ren could be Palpatines son or descendent. Or most likely just another with loon. When Luke does turn to the dark side he is under Palpatines sons rule. Then Luke turns back to kill him and is brought back into the light.
False,0,facepalm
False,0,Luke only turned briefly under the control of Palpatine when he revived himself 
False,0,"It's not luke, we've seen pictures of the person who is Kylo Ren. And it's definitely not luke."

False,0,I didn't like Vader after the transformation I felt not only he was on a leash but his reflexes seemed to be slowed and his force seemed weaker but before the transformation he seemed great

Long story short (SPOILER ALERT): Sidious used Maul as a way to draw out and eliminate Mother Talzin, who he saw as a potential rival to his eventual rule of the galaxy. He also fractured the Shadow Collective, leaving Maul on the run. That's the last we saw of him - Maul's fate is unknown at this time."

He stayed in Mustafar in a  of section of the facility that did not sink for years training himself to be like Vader  until he was rescued by a cult doing a homage to Vader, he then became leader and went in to gain rank in the Empire.    -Kevin J Anderson.

False,0,*Jedi were dying. (Correction) 
False,0,"Sifo dyas was tricked by darth plagieus and Sidious to make the clone army to ""help"" the Jedi in keeping peace because so many hedu were dying at the time. Dyas had no idea what it's real purpose was for"
False,0,"Canonically, Dooku doesn't pose as Sifo-Dyas. It was Sifo-Dyas himself who ordered the clone army. Sifo-Dyas was then killed by the Pyke Syndicate at the behest of Count Dooku, who took over the clone project by posing as a Jedi. The Kaminoans did not know that ""Tyranus"" was a Sith Lord."
False,0,"It was all a plan, count dooku pretending to be sifo Dias asked for a clone army of Jango Fett, with order 66 so they could overthrow the Jedi"
False,0,It was all consensual 
False,0,"Sifo dyas or however you spell it was working with the sith and so were the kaminoans, all in a plot to destroy the Jedi "
False,0,well the first appearance of the clones is Geonosis. Count Dooku was there
False,0,Information about who finding out about what?
False,2,Nah man they just payed them real well.
False,0,Darth sidious knew all about it
False,0,"Obi wan accepter his fate and gave his lifeforce to the force, while Qui gon died fighting, he didn't surrender his lifeforce, he was stolen from it"
False,0,Sorry not today yoda
False,0,"At the end of episode 3 today tells obi wan about additional training given to him by his old master. And at the screen in episode 4 where Vader strikes down obi wan his one of his last line is ""if you strike me down I will be more powerful than you can possibly imagine."" He understood how to become one with the force."
False,0,"it was not animation, bc Vader even feels the robe with his foot as though he was wondering where he went. Not really entirely sure why Ben vanished and Qui Gon did not"
False,0,You are actually right. now that I think about it. I completely forgot that Qui-gon said that.
False,3,"Qui-Gon's training as a spirit was incomplete. When he returned as a spirit in The Clone Wars episode ""Voices,"" he said he wasn't able to physically manifest himself. He could only be a disembodied voice. That's why he didn't disappear, because of his incomplete training with that secret power. But Obi-Wan and Yoda received full training, so they disappeared."
False,0,Qui gon then later became one with the force after he was being burned at his funeral
False,0,Its becuase obi wan knew and wanted to become one with the force but qui gon was caught off guard thats my theory.
False,0,"Well if that's the case, then obi-wan should've been cut in half. Qui-gon was a student of the living force too, so don't you think he should've disappeared instantly too, and immediately turn into a ghost? I'm gonna go with it was because of the ""budget and animation."""
False,0,"I think its because the Jedi had a special power where when they die, they could transform their body into another realm. (The one Luke sees obi wan and Yoda in). Im guessing Obi-Wan did this and Qui Gonn didn't? I could be completely wrong but I remember reading somewhere they could do that."
False,0,"Where is his purple object in Jurassic Park, or the Avengers, or The Other guys, or Deep Blue Sea? "
False,0,Samuel L. Jackson likes to have a purple object in movies he's in. I forget where I read that.

Windu: WHOOHOO!
but i want a purple one...
George: why? 
You can have a green or blue one.
Windu: I WANT PURPLE!!!
george: let me think about it..."
False,0,Because hes black
False,0,"Because when Lucas asked Jackson to be in Star Wars, Jackson demanded that 1. He didn't have a wimpy death in Ep. 3 and 2. That he had a unique lightsaber color. That being purple."
False,0,"For him to be a swordsman, he'd need to use a sword"
False,0,In the Jedi order he was second only to Yoda in dueling. Count dooku beat windu once and audio is could beat dooku as well but staged a loss to him to make anakin more susceptible to the dark side.
False,0,Being that he was a sentinel he would have practice and studied on both side of the force even though he was a pledged Jedi 
False,1,"He's one of the best Jedi at that time, his combat style flirts with the dark side. He is very strong and powerful, again at the time he is one of the best, sidious is also very good because he knows all seven forms. It's a toss up between him and a few other people. If we go back in history he is still ranked high but not the best."
False,0,He is good with the lightsaber but i dont think hes the best
False,0,Cin Draling could be up there as well.
False,0,The best swords men are jedi guardians they focus more on lightsaber battles
False,0,Yeash
False,0,Yup.
False,1,That wasn't Vader's ship. That was the small Corellian ship that R2d2 was still in when it got boarded by the Imperials.
False,0,"And maybe Obi wan still had a little bit of hope that he was still The Chosen One. After what happened on Mortis, it would be hard to think otherwise"
False,0,Anakin if I'm not mistaken was unarmed at that point which would make it a complete violation of the Jedi ways
False,0,"Among all of these other reasons, obi's fighting style stays away from killing people, he has a tendency to maim and incapacitate his foes."
False,0,Would you really finish him off if you were in his shoes?
False,1,"Man, they were brothers! (Metaforically) They loved each other! Anakin was a Dark Sider but Obi was still his friend... I think."
False,0,He told yoda he will not kill anakin
False,0,And wouldn't u assume that someone wouldn't survive being maimed and burned alive? 
False,0,It has to do with the Jedi Code.
False,1,for the same reason the Anakin didnt want to finish off Dooku
False,0,The Han Solo character will probably die most likely near the end of the movie 
False,0,Can it be Finn because in wiki there isnt john boyega at casting for episode 8

False,0,"honestly if you watch all the movies that are already out, youll be set"
False,0,Every episode of the Clone Wars is canon including the animatics they put on Starwars.com in 2015
False,0,Yes they are canon
False,0,"One of the trailers shows kylo not wearing a mask with his back turned against the camera, you clearly see his black hair so yeah it can't be luke."
False,0,I actually only have to wait two days ;) 
False,0,"Kylo Ren is not a sith, but is strong in the dark side of the force. He is part of a group called the Knights of Ren. "
False,0,He is also very strong with the force. Says on his wiki. 
False,0,Kylo is played by Adam Driver and one trailer specifically shows Kylo without his mask from behind. Luke is also in one of the trailers and is closer to resembling ObeeOne.  
False,0,"Think about it though: if Midi-Chlorians can conceive a baby, then why can't a powerful Sith like Plagueis (who spent his entire life studying them) and Sidious (who learned everything Plagueis knew) learn how to manipulate them in order to siphon life force between two force-connected beings like Anakin and Padmé? Again, the medical droid on Polis Massa said ""She's in perfect health. For reasons we can't explain, we're losing her"". Because of that statement, it certainly wasn't Anakin's force choke, otherwise she would have died before Vader and Obi-Wan's duel was over. And Sidious using a Sith technique in order to save Vader certainly makes more sense than ""she died of a broken heart"" or ""she just lost the will to live, despite her two children and her hope that there was still good in Anakin"". "
False,0,"Come on, crushed heart, half-crushed neck, low on energy and just had to deliver twins. I sense a low will to live."
False,0,"If she ""lost her will to live"" that's stupid because she needed to raise her two children, they should've been her will to live."
False,0,"No, she died from loosing energy from delivering Luke and Leia. It happens in the real world. "
False,0,"If you were someone as powerful as anakin, wouldn't you be able to crush their neck entirely. Sounds kinda gross. Couldn't show in the movies but it would be quicker. "
False,0,"PhoneCall. I trust that is sarcasm as not only is that a huge reach, but being able to manipulate the Medis to transfer life energy has never been considered, at least seriously "
False,0,İ wasnt especting that thx for that
False,5,"Nope, she didn't die from a broken heart, Palpatine killed her in order to save Anakin.
Remember when Palpatine told Anakin the story of Darth Plagueis? He said that Plagueis knew how to save people from death, and eventually revealed that he knew the technique. So, when Anakin was defeated by Obi-Wan and left to die on Mustafar, Palpatine used his master's force technique to essentially sap the life from Padmé (thus the medical droid saying ""for reasons we can't understand, we're losing her."") and give it to Anakin. Palpatine would have perfect reason to use Padmé because A) Anakin was attached to her, and his love for her could prove a danger to him, and B) she was carrying his child, who was a potential rival. That, and the bond Anakin and Padmé shared probably made it easier for Palpatine to sap her life. "
False,0,"Yeah, sucks that they wussed out on that . . . Dumb droid.


Anakin killing her outright and not having the kinda-sorta emotional suicide thing would have been better anyway is looked at "
False,1,"I think she technically died from the injuries she got from Anakin, but him turning made her loose her will to live. The medical droid said that in ep.III"
False,1,Fuck jar jar 
False,0,"I think it's an age gap thing. Younger fans like him or don't think he was that bad. But for me being older, I think he was horrible. I'm glad he's dead. And will not be in The Force Awakens. "
False,0,"@Weston gon jinn, I know right? I understand he is a little annoying but He is not that annoying enough for people wanting him dead."
False,1,I honestly don't understand the hate on Jar Jar I thought his character was some needed comic relief for the tragedy that was known to come 
False,0,"I think Jar Jar illustrates why many people don't like the prequels: it was very slapstick in its humor and it obviously pandered to the young audiences to the point where some parts felt like a kid's movie, and this is the trilogy that everyone knew would end in tragedy. It kind of had mixed messages in its tone, in short."
False,0,"He is jar jar I guess, and we can't change that, we can either accept the fact or complain about it but we can't change it, unless someone goes in and digitally adds a much cooler character over jar jar throughout the series"
False,0,I always go custom hand built 
False,0,"If you are using it for looks, get one for $10 at Walmart (or $12 if you want Kylo Ren's) but if you plan on doing a lot of actual swordplay, purchase a more expensive one. And I wouldn't use one of the bladebuilders for fighting. The better the quality, the better. And remember, light up ones don't usually close all the way."
False,0,I'd prolly want to get a purple one just because I think mace windu is sweet 
False,0,Depends what your favorite color is.
False,0,Online. 
False,0,Idk tbh I just want a lightsaber that's better than the plastic pieces of crap they have at Walmart and idk where to find them at

False,0,The backlash from the sith lightening cooked his insides and fried his robotic iron lung device that was helping him breathe.
False,0,"The Emperors force lightning shorted out his breathing device (its explains in the Vader (Legends) and I believe in Lords Of The Sith . . .

Also the energy (dark or what ever) from the emperor probably didn't help"
False,0,I guess Luke and Sith Lord 
False,0,Hwo kill him
False,0,Because he was weak from the force shock and he also had his mask taking off which he needs to breath unless he is in his chamber and ya I don't really thing hand being taking off had anything to do with it cuz shit he's lost his hands 5 times including that time 
False,0,"My guess is maybe it's in the star destroyer on jakku and Rey finds it, or kylo ren already has it and Finn steals it as he defects"
False,0,Someone found it then trys to sell it. It will change hands several times. Eventually ending up in Finn's hands. 
False,0,"I don't know how they will make the light sabor re appear but they will have to use something like it may have been caught in a tunnel like you know how there were a bunch of outputs not just one maybe it got caught in there and someone found it 
"
False,0,They'll think of something for why it's on Jakku
False,0,Yeah in the new movie Finn finds it 
False,0,Oh ok
False,0,I mean the old light saber that use to be his dad's not the new one he made that green 
False,0,The house at tatoiine

False,0,"They should have tidied up the story after TFU2, but it's not part of the new plan for star wars, so there won't be another"
False,1,Seeing it Thursday at 9:20 in 3 D just because my movie theater sold out the first couple showings in ten minutes 
False,1,It releases on December 16th in South Africa so will be seeing it then
False,1,Going to see a whole showing of all movies in both trilogies (chronological order) including force awakens on the big screen in theatre on the 17th. It was a 75 dollar ticket but so worth it because  I can say I've seen every star wars movie on big screen. 
False,0,I'm going to see it a day or two after the 18th. 
False,1,Taking my daughters two nights in a row.

False,0,Phase 1
False,0,"To be honest, I like the old republic armor the best. It looks so awesome. Especially havoc squads armor "
False,0,Classic 
False,0,I prefer the phase II
False,0,"I still prefer the phase II and it's variants, but after seeing the first order in action... Who knows..."
False,0,"Phase I was the coolest.
Phase II was the best.
Phase III was a classic.
Thoe others are all fakes.

Holy cow it rhymes!"

False,1,". . . Too old to begin the training . . .  Of course Leia going dark side would be on the boarder of interesting  to stupid, buuuutttt. . . The Sith did prefer older apprentices so there's that "
False,0,"I like the fact that it seems like she won't be a Jedi in the new movies. She seems like the type of person who wouldn't want to become a Jedi, because she'd be too busy kicking butt militarily."
False,3,Trilogy? Nah. Single movie? Hell yes. 
False,0,I'm certain they are not a force sensitive race
False,0,"Yes, I think I read a article theses days saying that geonosians are one of the species that cannot ""became a Jedi"". But I'm not quite sure..."
False,0,I looked up that name in the wiki. I couldn't find anything. 
False,1,Thanks :)
False,1,"YES INFACT. his name is Xaezhul he is a Jedi of the house Odan-Urr.
"
False,0,Kylo Kybo both using Ren. Kinda funny. 
False,0,"They are very original, yup."
False,0,It is pretty rough and cheesy 
False,0,I suppose so but I don't think anyone's seen it XD
False,0,"Padmé is four or five years older than Anakin, so yeah."
False,0,Haha that would be pretty freaking funny to see 
False,0,"What if Jar Jar is Kylo. The last scene is Kylo holding Vaders mask. He takes off he own and says,""Meesa avenge you Ani!"""

False,0,No.

False,0,No. 
False,0,"I'm half hoping for that to happen just to see 75% of the fan base ragequit, but I half don't want it to happen because I'd probably be part of that 75%."
False,0,"Question is, why does anyone like him?^ (the comment about jar jar"
False,0,Why does everybody hate JarJar
False,0,"He's a villain and a good one at that: He cheats, he is a coward, he's pretty powerful, he schemes...
Anything you could want really!"
False,1,He's plan old silly in his fight with yoda
False,0,He pisses me off tbh but that's only because he turned anakin bad and anakin was awesome 
False,0,İ hate him lol 
False,0,Who hates him??
False,0,He is pretty awesome actually
False,0,Unlimited power XD
False,0,"""Is"" my bad"
False,0,It would be more fair if you did a odst vs  arc trooper
False,0,"Lol, due to the fact that storm troopers fail to kill a target every single time, even when there are hundreds of them, due to their awful accuracy... I'm gonna go with Spartan. "
False,0,This is like saying if a Rattlesnake or a legless mouse would win. 
False,0,"Arc trooper vs John117. 117 wins
Bad batch vs Blue Team. That would be interesting"
False,0,"Of course the spartan would win, even if he's a IV gen, the trooper does not stand the chance"

2 Darth Nihilus- He could have drained solar systems and maybe the galaxy
3 Darth Krayt- He survived many deaths "
False,1,Darth Bane
False,0,No
False,0,This is the YouTube video I was referring to; watch at your own risk:  http://youtu.be/uKUd6Ugz1EA
False,0,I've haven't been watching the newest ones because I want it all to be a mystery. 
False,1,Someone has spliced all the various trailers together into a pretty coherent plot summary.  You can find it on YouTube.
False,1,We've only seen 8 minutes of Mish mash stuff from at 2:40 hour movie
False,0,Exactly! I think a shock is going to be in store for us all come this weekend!
False,0,Not much footage has been released. Most of what we do see is all from the same sequences. There's really no way to accurately predict what this movie is about from the trailers alone.
False,0,A little.
False,1,YES
False,2,Not at all. Everything we've seen has been from the first third of the movie. And when they show us something new it's only about a second more of the same part of what we've already seen. Should they stop? Sure. I've already been sold on it. I don't want to see anymore. But I will keep watching if they keep putting more out. 
False,0,Hey babe you be anakin and I'll be Obi Wan and I'll be your master 
False,0,Shak Ti 
False,0,I think Voss Quinlan survived in exile after his failed attempt to kill Doku
False,0,"Ashoka Tano, I think?"
False,0,There was a Verpine Jedi that survived order 66 but he died by Vader later. (I forgot his name)
False,0,"There is a whole list on this app just look up ""Jedi purge survivors"""
False,0,Rahm Kota
False,1,"Luminara Unduli survived the initial execution of Order 66, but she was killed during the Jedi Purge by the Grand Inquisitor. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Luminara_Unduli"

False,2,"If there's grass on that field, play ball! 🙊"
False,0,"Either way, he looks way older"
False,0,Omg😂🔥
False,2,14 year olds are allowed to look but not touch.
False,0,No but she liked him as soon as they met
False,0,"AOTC occurred 10 years after they met, making Padme 24 and Anakin 20.  Perfectly legal. "
False,0,"Yet in attack of the clones, she could have been in her early 20s, while he was in his late 20s. 

Bad casting"
False,1,"She tried her best to resist his >20,000 midichlorian-count, but to no avail. "
False,0,And you can tell she liked him right then and there. Creeps me out when I think about that!
False,0,"Payne was 14 when she met Anakin, age 10!"
False,0,Typical sith-rip off
False,0,"Vader was the greatest Jedi killer of all time, so maybe Kylo wants to kill them all
"
False,0,For everyone's information there is a guy playing Kylo Ren and it isn't Mark Hamil. Therefore the oddly popular theory of Kylo Ren being Luke is invalid. 
False,0,The uprise of The New Order? 
False,0,He presumably means the destruction of the Jedi.
False,0,Luke is the only one that knows how Darth Vader(Anakin)died.Luke also knows how Emporer Papatine Died to.
False,0,Kylo Ren says that because it is Luke Skywalker(My Theroy of course)
False,0,Why wouldn't Luke tell anyone? He wouldn't want people thinking his father died a villain 
False,2,"Good is a point of view.  No one but Luke Skywalker knows that Anikan, Vader killed the emperor in the end!"
False,3,"The Jedi did find out that Dooku ordered the clones, actually.

In The Clone Wars episode ""The Lost One,"" Obi-Wan and Anakin find out what happened to Sifo-Dyas - Dooku ordered him killed, and the Pyke Syndicate carried out the hit over a moon of Oba Diah. The Jedi also learned that Dooku was Tyranus and was behind the creation of the clone army, but they felt they had no choice but to continue using the clones to fight the Sith.

Here's the episode page: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lost_One

And here's the page about Sifo-Dyas: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sifo-Dyas"
False,0,"No, or the Jedi would have known Count Dooku was the one who ordered the clones."
False,0,My bets on C3-PO losing his only golden arm and he's going to have 2 red arms by the next movie 
False,0,"Before Han and Leia split up, She had an affair with Lando, the result was Fynn. 

I'm not serious btw"
False,0,"First - Mara is EU, thus not canon. Second - I don' think that white people having black children is too often. Finn is black. Maybe Lando's son, but not Luke's."
False,0,Going back to Finn not being a Skywalker there is small speculation that after maria jade Skywalker died Luke re-married and Finn is his son but its very unlikely but is something to think about.
False,0,"I'm affraid that would be racism. Finn's gonna get his background kicked hard, but he'll be fine."
False,0,Oh someone's going loose a limb. I'd put money on it. 
False,0,Lol
False,4,Wouldn't be starwars without someone losing a limb.
False,0,Why is it a small chance?
False,2,Finn isn't a Skywalker. But there is a very very very very very small chance of that happening.
False,0,"Yeah. If we managed to get him into our universe ANYBODY could kill him. EVEN A BABY. Though it would have to be a Baby trained in the ways of the force...
(Joking)"
False,0,"Well I think Chuck Norris could. Because the Force doesn't exist in our universe, so Kylo would be at a disadvantage"
False,0,Haha I could not! He is a god
False,0,Well obviously no normal Star Wars Fan will.
False,0,Psssssht I could. 
False,0,Anakin was 9
False,0,Finn may not be trained as a jedi but after the but around 2 ABY the stormtroopers began to be trained in vibroblade fighting which are very similar to lightsabers this could possibly be where he learned to weild a lightsaber
False,2,Technically Luke was never formally trained he self trained himself mostly and dabbled in the light and dark side of the force. The only Skywalker that went through the process of Padawanship was Anakin. 
False,0,"Anakin was 10 when Quigon Jin brought him to the Jedi Council for consideration to enter into training.  The age restriction is not a code exactly, more of a guideline.  Luke was their one of two New Hopes left."
False,0,"The had an age limit because there was an official council back then. But when Luke came around they trained him because he was there only hope 
"
False,0,Yoda was convinced by obi wan both times in VI and I plus what darthblackmanna said
False,1,"Finn may not be trained at all. Just because someone can wield a lightsaber doesn't mean they've been trained as a Jedi. Odds are he was trained in combat as a stormtrooper, and that's the training he uses when he wields the lightsaber."
False,0,"Desperate times, desperate measures. "
False,0,"I agree with banes heart, he also would know which form he would use before crafting his own light saber and he wouldn't make one impractical or dangerous to himself so it has to be purely beneficial"
False,0,"To Wroe81.  I think kylo's mix of juyo and Ataru allow him to fight, as those forms don't require much wrist movement."
False,0,"The cross guard provides hand protection as well as a way to catch an enemy saber. The guard won't be cut off (contrary to popular belief) because the emitter of a lightsaber has a magnetic field around it. This would protect it. Even if there was no magnetic field.
The guard could be made out of cortosis or another saber resistant material."
False,0,"I don't see how it would do anything other than sear his own face off. 1. If you look closely, there are projections sticking out slightly where the beams are emitted. Unless they're coated with phrik or some other lightsaber-resistant substance, you could just cut through those. 2. If they are what Disney says they are (energy exhaust vents), then they would be formless, and, while able to cut/burn things, they wouldn't be able to deflect anything. 3. It's just kind of a dumb concept. It would make all but the simplest techniques impossible without cutting his own hand off. I know the crossguard saber's been used before, but Roblio Darté's is the only other example of it, and his is far more practical because it only has one and it's at a 45 degree angle, which would allow it to clear his hand with only minimal adjustment.  "
False,0,The crossguard had been used before him and it is to protect the users hand and wrists so they don't get anakined

False,0,I haven't been deleting your post. I don't think that anyone has the ability to do that except for Brandon.
False,0,"In Episode V Yoda says ""there is another"" and in Episode VI he says ""there is another Skywalker"" so my bet is in both cases he's referring to Vader or Leia. Thoughts?"
False,0,Can it be finn oh he is to old to be trained and all of that shit
False,0,"Also, that happens in ""Empire Strikes Back"", not Revenge of the Sith."
False,0,"I think you mean that obi wan refers to Luke as the last hope,but the other is Leia."

False,0,"I just went to the ""Conflicts"" category and read about all of the big wars and conflicts from the beginning, reading any related articles that piqued my interest."
False,0,Glad I could be of an assistance 
False,0,"I know what Disney did, and it was a simple yes or no qiestion, but thank you. 😐"
False,0,"The tiss'shar are not part of the proper Star Wars story. Before Disney took over Star Wars, there was expanded universe. This meant that things like comics were true to the story. For example Han and Leia get married. But now the expanded universe has been scrapped. So things like the Han and Leia getting married have been scrapped and made legends. This is all because of Disney as they are the ones who got rid of it. They call everything that is part of the actual Star Wars story ""cannon"". These consist of the 6 films, clone wars to series and some comics. It is complicated but that's the idea. Sorry if that makes no sense "
False,0,"So in conclusion : The Tiss'shar don't exist in the "" new "" Star wars franchise. "
False,0,"At the top of each profile it says cannon and legend. If it is under cannon, it means the information is verified by Disney as being true "
False,0,"So in conclusion: The Tiss'shar don't exist in the ""new"" Star wars franchise."
False,0,Crap I texted the thing in the wrong discussion 
False,0,So basically the /Legends on the same thing that is canon doesn't count?
False,0,*canon and not canon!*
False,0,"No. Because they are only Legends, there is no need for the /legends. They do not get mentioned or appear in cannon"
False,0,"Because in canon, not as much info is given on the species as what it was in Legends."
False,0,"All canon pages have their URL adress without / with Canon. But if that subject has its Legends page, URL adress with /Canon will work. That's because one can see if a subject in canon exists in Legends. It has its usage in Appearances and links generally."
False,0,"Cannon means that it appears in the main Star Wars films or other extra comics, tv shows that Disney have agreed to be part of the true story "
False,0,*canon and not canon!*
False,0,It doesn't make sense how the same thing can be canon not canon!
False,0,"I agree with joespear, there are a lot of things that are no longer canon, which would explain why there is a lot less"
False,0,The only difference between the 2 is that the /Legends tell A LOT more information on them. and the other one doesn't. It doesn't make any sense!
False,0,I think when it is Kel Dor it is cannon only. But when you do Kel Dor/legends it will bring up the more in depth search. But don't hold me to that 
False,0,"I know what A kel dor is. I'm just saying why is it like ""Kel dor"" and then a thing called ""kel dor/Legends"" I know what legends mean but how does it effect a alien species?"
False,0,"Kel Dor is the race that Plo Koon is, perhaps if you had searched a related subject it would bring that up"
False,0,No Kylo Ren is being played by another actor. Also Mark Hamil isn't so slim haha
False,0,"That's the EU, so it doesn't afflict the movies, which are canon."
False,0,"He's not. Didn't they confirm that? Either way, Disney isn't going to make the novels part of canon I think."
False,0,"AV-6R7, I'm fairly certain the Empire never exterminates the Geonosians. If I'm wrong, and they do (in Legends), please let me know where that is said. Otherwise, or if they do only in canon, oh well. "
False,0,I don't remember that happeining. It said in the time line  that the Geonosians were there when the Vong attacked the galaxy. And Disney isn't going to make it happened since their stupid thing in 2014.
False,0,"I would also like to see this occur, though I would note that the Empire does eventually exterminate the Geonosians."
False,0,"I rather doubt there will be anytime soon, but I think it would be interesting. If any of you have seen any of my other posts, you know I disapprove of what Disney has done. But I think it does have some merit, and I do like the idea of Separatist rebels. There were some In the EU, but most chose to fight the Empire in their own way, but those that survived into the Rebellion era agreed on mutual non-interference. "
False,0,"No leaders, just regular people who were fighting for the Separatist cause. "
False,0,"Like who? Like I said, Viceroy, Poggle, Wat Tambor, and San Hill are dead. "
False,0,Zar-Di-Kor - I would go with original characters we've never seen before. 
False,0,"Well in Legends there were the Separatist holdouts, so perhaps some Gizor Dellso-type character may surface, finding a droid factory, starting it up, and creating his own army to fight the Empire."
False,0,But who?
False,0,"I would hope that none of the Separatist leaders are still around. Those leaders were all evil, and pretty one-note at that. The most interesting characters to me were the ones that largely went unseen, the ones who made the statement ""there are heroes on both sides"" true. I would like to see Separatist remnants based on those who were actively fighting for freedom."

That's why you can have Luke on Hoth wearing his Return of the Jedi costume and fighting Darth Vader, for example."
False,0,Ayrehead02
False,0,"Oh yeah they will definitely add Finn, Rey, Kylo and Captain Phasma but wouldn't it be cool if they expanded the game to host all characters... Adding Greedo, Darth maul, Chewbacca, and many others would make it even better"
False,0,And Kathleen Kennedy keeps spreading lies about the EU. She is the worst.
False,1,Disney = a retarded company. 
False,0,"Well, i. e. Plagueis talking with Sidious is now canon (two sentences), that originates from EU book. But the book itself cannot be canon, because it was already overriden by the very last Dark Horse Maul comics. And Maul surviving... Well, to sum it up, continuity errors were in the EU and they are in canon as well."
False,0,"The difference now isn't that the whole EU is no longer true. The reason why they're calling it ""Legends"" instead of ""fanfiction"" is because the stories in the EU could still be true until movies or new canon material changes it, if it ever does. So you can pretty much believe whatever you want as far as EU goes."
False,2,"Well, we can always think that Disney's version is a alternate universe. "
False,1,"Darth Bane was also created by George Lucas, he just never put it into the movies. So Bane was always canon in his mind, and he finally became part of the official non-EU canon in The Clone Wars. However, the novels and comics about him from the EU are not canon, as Tyler pointed out."
False,0,"Darth Bane is canon, but nothing about him except from his appearance in TCW is canon."
False,0,He did fall to the dark side when palpatine returned as many clone replicas but he redeemed himself later on
False,0,"No, Mark Hamill said it is more of an Obi-Wan type role "

False,0,"SPOILER ALERT. All indications from the producers suggest that the Sith are gone. Doesn't necessarily mean they can never come back, but it does mean that there probably are no Sith in The Force Awakens."
False,0,With Kylo Ren And Captain Phasma as the main bad guys it makes you wonder if the sith are still around with enough influence to resurface and become the main baddies
False,0,Kylo Ren is confirmed to not be a Sith. He is part of the Knights of Ren: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Knights_of_Ren

False,0,Pass.
False,0,I don't think it will surpass the original trilogy it should be epic though! 
False,2,"Looking forward to it!

VAN1SH915 - more basic action tends to work better with audiences than in-your-face action. I think J.J. Abrams will find a nice balance between them in this film."
False,1,"I feel like it'll be the best one yet, original trilogy fanboys will say otherwise but it's true... I love the original trilogy but the action was so basic because of what they had to work with in the 70s...with the tech we have today there's no way it won't be better then the rest in the series"

False,0,@Zar-Di-Kor The canon reboot happened in April 2014 so all multimedia except from the movies and The Clone Wars show were then Legends.
False,0,"@Tyler Ren, what do you mean when they were published UNTIL 2014?"
False,1,Thank you
False,0,"Canon- What Disney considers as the true story of Star Wars (the movies, TV shows (Rebels & The Clone Wars (2008-2014), and most novels and comic books from April 2014 onward)

Legends- anything such as comics, novels, video games, etc that was published up until April 2014."
False,0,Kylo isn't a sith though..
False,0, Harrison Ford said that the story and some characters' origin is cannot be deduced and it will be a big surprise. So i dont think so

False,0,"I think it's Jacen Solo,because KYLO Ren. 
Ky from Skywalker and Lo from Solo."
False,0,"Son of Leia and Han? Possibly. Jacen? No, since the EU isn't canon anymore."
False,0,"Yes, I think he is a son of Han and Leia, too."
False,0,NNOOOOOO! HAN SOLO CANNOT DIE!!!!!! HE'S THE MOST AWESOME CHARACTER!!!!!!!
False,0,I don't think Chewie will die. Maybe Han.
False,0,Chewbacca's death from the NJO series isn't canon anymore guys. Jacen Solo too.
False,0,Han solo will be killed by Jacen Solo....Darth Caedus
False,0,Chewy should've been dead
False,0,Well chronologically he should've been dead for a decade
False,0,Han.
False,0,I'm betting Han.

False,0,2008-2014 for sure. 
False,0,"2008+.   I could not even watch the two version because the crappy animation was to much of a distraction.   The 2008+ and Rebels have improved greatly, but why they don't improve the quality of animation is baffling "
False,0,"Although I think the older one has some charm to it, I prefer the newer one."
False,0,I prefer the newer one. 
False,1,I like the older one but I prefer the newer one. It went much deeper into the story of the war and created stories that I think are vital to the overall Star Wars mythos.
False,0,I haven't seen the older one 
False,0,2008 to 2014
False,1,The older one. Durge owns everybody.
False,0,"I recognized a bit of rivalry/friendship at the same time between Finn and Poe during one of the trailers. I think that they went head to head once ( after all, we are talking about an X-wing pilot and a stormtrooper), and when Finn's TIE Fighter goes down, I bet Poe shot it down. Thoughts?"
False,0,Crazy thing was is heart died not his brain
False,0,"I have a stupid theory: General Grievous comes back. Sure people will say its impossible, but a lot of people died and came back as a cyborg. It could be possible that Grievous is re-revived as a Cyborg again. "
False,0,I think kylo ren is the son of Han and Leia and possibly a former apprentice of Luke who turned bad 
False,0,Thank God somebody else finally thinks the same thing
False,0,"Rex932 - the Resistance and the Rebel Alliance are not the same. The Rebel Alliance became the New Republic after the Battle of Endor. From what we can tell, the New Republic still exists during The Force Awakens, but they're not part of the film's events. The Resistance is something new, something fighting against the First Order. Why the Resistance is separate from the New Republic is something we'll find out this week!"
True,1,Who you think is Kylo Ren?For me is Jacen Solo
False,0,"The Resistance is too generic a name. The First Order is okay, but somehow feels a bit bland."
False,0,Maybe the new names are cool
False,0,"I don't understand what's Resistance. New Republic failed again, or what?"
False,0,"Well the Rebel Alliance and the Resistance are the same thing. 
The Empire and The First Order are not the same thing"
False,0,The alliance kinda is weird I like to just call it the original name not the resistance but I don't mind the first order 
False,0,No I've wanted them since I was 3

False,0,No that's not weird its life live it the way you want.
False,0,"I am all of the jealous, and I'm 37..."
False,1,No way! that's awesome. 
False,0,"Who's talking about canon? I don't give a damn about canon, that's for bandwagoners and ""true"" fans. EU has been left unfinished, nothing more. Once again, canon or EU, I don't care, EU was canon and I didn't care, because I liked the stories, not their canonical status. Movies were always superior to it and could override it. I like Episodes I to VI, although the prequels weren't that great. And I know that Disney want money, but that's not reason why the EU had to be stopped without giving it a proper ending. EU generated money, too (not comparable with movies, of course). And yeah, Legends logo pretty much explains that the story isn't canon, so no, people wouldn't be confused (and if they were, they are dumb, period). I don't need EU movies or TV series. Even one EU book per a year or even two years would be fine. So, hyping fans up with Jaina trilogy (finally), then cancel it and offer them reboot, but now officially canonical (recognized by whoever from Disney who never read the EU and won't read canon either) is backstab. I don't blame Disney, I blame Kennedy more, she 66'ed the EU. Disney want only money, from all sources, including the EU.
Yeah, usual continuity problems, caused by awesome TCW, right? TCW should never interfere with the EU and everything would be fine. TCW caused huge continuity errors, that could have been prevented, if it only used the EU as a source and told stories in the canonical way. In the same way as Tarkin novel, that uses a lot of EU sources.
Fan fiction - Christie Golden, J. J. Miller, Paul S. Kemp, James Luceno, they all wrote fan fiction, and now they write fan fiction recognized by Disney. Cool. I could add an insultive word ""glorified"", but I won't, because that's what EU haters do. I rate canonical books on the same level as EU books (doesn't count for Aftermath, an abomination).
And same for you. All I'm saying is your reason (as I respect it) is short sited. Hopefully when you do see it ""wink"" you dig it.
To sum it up, I own this Tarkin book, and that's all. I have an access to other things (Aftermath herkily jerkily), but no, thanks. You can enjoy TFA and canon, I will read the rest of the EU (and I still have a lot to go through), and maybe one day, when Kennedy is off from Lucasfilm, a good person that actually cares about all SW fans, will give me (and us) Jaina's story, while Finn's son will fight against First Order on the screen in SW: Episode XX.
Sorry for mistakes, not a native speaker and writing quickly."
False,0,"Hyger3: So you're mad because Disney said that the EU is no longer canon? I don't get the anger. You would deny your self the experience of watching an amazing movie (hopefully) Because of that? C'mon buddy. Personally, when I first heard that they did that I thought it was kinda dumb. But I didn't care. And then I thought about why they did it. 1. Always money. But 2. Look at the EU as a whole. Look at all of the characters, look at all of the different stories. Look at it. That's a resource that you can pull from over and over again. Pull from it. Use it. Make characters and story arcs canon. Not to mention the fact that a lot of that stuff is fan fiction and all of the continuity problems. And being a supporter and fan for decades now, I don't feel in any way shape or form that I've been stabbed in the back. All I'm saying is your reason (as I respect it) is short sited. Hopefully when you do see it ""wink"" you dig it. "
False,0,Yes! I will not be on this or Facebook until I watch it!!!!
False,0,"Darth Vulture: I'm boycotting it, the whole Disney canon. Not gonna support company that backstabbed its old fans and supporters. That doesn't mean I'll ignore it completely, I'll read the plot on Wookieepedia so I will know everything important."

False,0,Cheaper to buy it than pay to see it a theater. Tickets sold out we're I'm from. Might have to work also.
False,1,For real who won't watch it that's on this app
False,0,"Lol, okay, now they are not the EU anymore, as I checked Wookieepedia and was a bit surprised. But I like it, I always disliked what have TCW caused to continuity. Too bad the rest of TCW media aren't canon. If only Lucasfilm cared, that would solve many errors and brough back true EU Mandos."
False,0,"Umm, what? Unluckily, they were part of the EU, as far as I know (which caused continuity errors, ruined Mandalorians and killed Piell twice)."
False,1,"To clarify Andykatib's point, The Clone Wars was never part of the Expanded Universe since it was George Lucas' show, so Mortis was not an EU creation. It did, however, factor into the Fate of the Jedi novels, which were part of the EU."
False,0,"Thanks, I always felt like there was more from mortis besides those 3 episodes"
False,0,"It was a plot device used by the producers of The Clone Wars to explain how Anakin Skywalker failed in his mission to be the prophesied ""Chosen One."" It was one of the EU elements to survive the 2014 ""purge."" So it's now officially Canon. "
False,0,I think it would work more like tumblr than Facebook
False,1,I think it should be set up similarly to Facebook where u click on their profile and you can see their posts. And you should let us post pictures of fan art and #starwarsmoments

False,0,The cross-guard protects the hand/arm. Brilliant design feature considering at least one person gets their hand/arm cut off in every movie. 👎😂 
False,0,"I just saw Colbert's video, and while it makes an interesting point, he clearly doesn't understand lightsaber mechanics. Not only did he call it a ""plasma beam"", his explanation is simply an (in-universe) impossibility. While the beam itself is formed below where the hilt stops and the blade begins, the beam emitter (yes, that's a technical term) is right at that point. If the emitter is damaged, the lightsaber will stop working, and may even explode if it isn't immediately powered off. "
False,0,It's pretty dumb. 
False,0,Stephen Colbert has a great explanation on the logistics of Kylo's saber. It's worth checking out
False,0,The crossgaurd is an actual thing in the mideveal tomes used to protect the useres hands

False,1,Han becoming a Jedi.
False,0,"The biggest twist would be if Kylo cloned  Darth Vader and Then Vader and Kylo killed Luke, Rey, Finn, and Poe"
False,1,Yes. The EU would become canon. That would be the biggest plot twist.
False,0,Kylo is actually darth maul with a suit similar to vaders for legs and hes out to destroy the remaining jedi because they remind him of his tragedy on naboo
False,0,Finn dies and a black lives matters protest shows up. 
False,0,"Biggest twist is that Kylo Ren is so obsessed with Darth Vader because he wishes to make up for the time he wasn't with his Son, Anakin. 

And that he is actually The Father of Mortis, who didn't die during the clone wars"

False,1,"In the view of the Rebel leadership, this was their best shot at taking out the Death Star. It was a dangerous gamble and it paid off due to Luke Skywalker and Han Solo's actions during the Battle of Yavin. In war,  you have to make a lot of risks.

False,0,Yoda
False,0,QGJ had a lot of knowledge of the force. He had so much knowledge he was able to communicate with Yoda after his death but in a lightsaber dual I don't think he could win.

False,0,In 1v1 easy Yoda. He is stronger with the force.
False,0,Yoda all the way

False,0,Well they started out as a race and then they had some sort of king who they called the dark lord of the sith then other species came to korriban and started learning from the sith species and they started to call themselves the sith and whoever could kill the current dark lord of the sith would become the new dark lord of the sith so the first sith was the first person that was sith species

False,0,"The Force willed the Midi Chlorians to conceive Anakin. Is about the jist of what it is.

Plageuis experimented manipulating the MC for various things, one trying to find immortality.

In Tarkin, Palpatine mentions that Plageuis mentioned once the Force could strike back.

My takeaway from that was that the Force conceived Anakin in retaliation and gave him such high counts of MCs to give him a stronger connection to the Force.

""Anyone think it would be helpful if this app had a thig call your posts so you won't have to scroll down for ages""

I can confirm that we are going to build a function where you can see all of the posts you've made.

""Also possibly add a pictures upload so we can share stuff like that but knowing people....that would get abused real fast...""

Adding Images will be something that will be released in early 2016. It will start with one image per post, but we'll grow it from there.

""Would be good to have closed groups so their is a frequent income of comments and stuff not from random people.""

We may add the ability to create a private forum for admins/mods to talk in private, but beyond that we have no plans to create private forums. Much like the spirit of Wikia in general, we want the forum to be open to everyone.

""The forum just needs to have a better setup in general. Something like an actual forum, complete with a strong set of rules and non-abusive moderators.""

I can officially confirm that we will be adding sub-forums early in 2016.

As for rules, that's up to the Wookieepedia community. I have stressed that it's better to let things be a bit less restrictive at first to see how the forum evolves, and then rules can be created from there."

False,0,"My wife and I just completed Flashback Order, IV-V-I-II-III-VI. This is the first time I viewed the episodes in this order and I think it was very fulfilling. It keeps all the plot twists and spoilers intact and makes for an enjoyable experience. Cutting episode I out, to me, misses out on the full message. Yes, you can do it, but it shows Anakin's full evolution, and already aquatints us with Shmi so his return for her makes more sense. As well as Watto's scene in Episode II, without one their exchanges make little difference. Last part- going from V to I is also quite enjoyable in the swordsman aspect. Seeing Darth Vader and Luke crossing blades and then a bit later watching Darth Maul take on two Jedi at once!"

False,0,By the time of the trilogy there's an all out war. I doubt the Empire would risk Inquisitors for everything our heroes were doing. Luke seemed to be Vader's own pet project to boot. But you could be right that they splintered from the Inquisitorial branch. They may also just be general Dark Side force users. 
False,0,"Like the Knights of Ren might be the last of the Inqusitors?

False,0,"It's like Jedizan said, he was simply a marketing tool meant to appeal to kids. But let's think for a bit about the fact that Jar Jar was meant to be the Prequel equivalent of Chewbacca. Why does Chewbacca work when Jar Jar failed? Because Chewbacca was allowed to be his own Character. He wasn't shoehorned into scenes where he wasn't needed or shoved down the audience's throats. Bottom line, he wasn't superfluous. "
False,0,"I don't know, but in my opinion, he is the only truly kind character in the whole saga."
False,0,"I feel you need to rewatch the prequels. Jar-Jar made the motion for Palpatine to have emergency rights to rule the senate how he saw fit.

Seeing their relationship start from Episode I and on makes all the events that transpire make so much more sense. "
False,0,He was just a marketing tool to appeal towards children which ultimately backfired on george

False,2,"Honestly, Yoda is the only one I'd really like to see pop up.

If you're talking about the shape-shifting bounty hunter from earlier in the movie, that Obi-Wan were chasing, because she tried killing Padmè, I can never remember her/it's name. And Boba, technically is a clone of Jango that he had brought to him from how do u say it, when it's not a birth, from when boba was freshly cloned?

False,0,There was a guy on u tube that was reviewing the lightsaber. He demonstrates how it could be handled quickly. The guy was spinning the saber all over the place. You would think it handled like a medevil broadsword.
False,0,I don't think Kylo's blade is ancient because it is younger than the Battle of Yavin. It would be interesting to see him wield it in the movie though. With thoose crossguards he would have to make wider and more powerful blows unlike a standard lightsaber.

Legends is everything else that branched off of the star wars movies, in sidestories like Starfighter, or the future, like Legacy.

I dont like the fact of battledroids as it creates a giant technilogical hole in the star wars universe where as the OT had no droids which were soley designed to destroy/kill (disregarding IG-88) it makes the prequels seem to take place AFTER the OT. the clone trooper armor was sleek, the stormtrooper armor looks like a plastic costume made by a kid compared to the phase 1 and 2 clones. That is what pretty much bothers me the most. Grievous was nerfed down to a coughing pussy always on the run, Jango Fett had a terribly scripted death, and darth maul should have not been killed off in TPM. He should have been the main villian in the PT, as vader was the main villian in the OT. George's direction for hayden as Anakin was horrid. Hayden is not a bad actor, his character in Star Wars was just terribly scripted, as was Obi Wan at times. The prequels to me are ""turn off your brain"" movies, as they make no sense in almost every wag. Oh the whole fetish lucas had about having everything connected is putrid. In Star Wars, theres no such thing as a coincidence i guess "

False,0,You mean the Originals? Was there in 1977 first day with a bunch of friends. 👍🏻🌺
False,0,"To simply summarize an answer, as opposed to the one above (sorry, I only skim read it, but I liked what I saw) They relied to heavily on the special effects."
False,1,"(Mega Post incoming)

I like the prequels. Not as much as the originals of course, but I enjoyed them for what they were. TPM had some oddities, like Jar Jar (Though tbh, Gungans by themselves are pretty awesome, though that strictly going off my heavy Galactic Battlegrounds exposure), lack a clear cut main character (Is it Qui-Gon? Is it Obi-Wan? Anakin? The Queen? Jar Jar? Ric Olie?), and the lack of a clear plot. It's almost a random events plot tied loosely together by ""Planet in Peril needs to Saved."" However, the lore surrounding it made a lot of sense and tied everything together, but I think the problem is that it tried to give us too many story points and it didn't really deliver on any of them with a solid conclusion. It gave us too much and nothing at all. However, I actually liked the politics, I thought the mixture of CG and practical effects were top notch (I still think that it's the best looking, and best designed Star Wars film. Artists like Doug Chiang and Terryl Whitlatch did work for this film that was absolutely beautiful), the Podrace scene, while sort of pointless with it's forgone conclusion, was perhaps the most thrilling thing for me personally (I played the Podracing game to death and I've done a lot of Podracing related work on this wiki), and I actually liked the villains to an extent: weedy bureaucratic types who still managed to be slick, sadistic beings led by a dark and mysterious, yet wholly obvious as to his identity, being.

AotC started to sort of bring things together. The plot was still very all over the place, but it managed to tie everything together by the end to an extent that was okay. Someone once complained to me that the clone-spiracy about Sifo-Dyas and Dooku and Tyrannus was too complicated, and they felt that all of that info almost required prior-knowledge to something before seeing the film. I for one sort of understood it when I first saw it: Aliens said Sifo ordered it, Jango said he was hired as the template by Tyrannus, who is later revealed to be Dooku. Easy enough. But with that said, it raises a lot of questions, and if it confused one person, then it probably confused a lot more. Again, this was all explained in detail in other sources, but even with a universe as big as Star Wars, details pertaining to a film should be revealed within the film. There's a lot of people who don't look into the other material to understand all of the layered meaning, much of which probably wasn't even explained in detail to those writing the film. Focus of the film is more clearly present on Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Padme this time around, while Yoda and Mace Windu work well as supporting characters without seeming like they're intruding on the main stars and their story(ies). The villains, Dooku and Jango, also don't unnecessarily waste the viewer's time, either. Acting wise, Ewan McGregor and Portman both do fine, an Hayden, eh... As far as this film is concerned, I think he could have been better. He was wooden at times, or too angsty other times (Though he managed to do this scenes with a believable amount of angst). The Romance failed because of a lack of chemistry. Nothing Portman/Hayden did made me believe these two were committed in a relationship. However, I feel a lot of this was both the script's fault, and Lucas' fault as a director. Poor acting can be derived from the actor, but it can also be blamed on the director not looking for better scenes, cuts, or direction. The script just gave them awful lines to boot (Sand. It's all gritty. Gets in your teeth). I actually liked this film a little less than TPM, but in a film sense, I do believe this is a genuinely good, or OK film. It's just not exceptional, nor is it great. 

RotS is the best prequel, though that might not be saying much. It's certainly better than the last two films. The plot was tighter, but it didn't allow for too much action, which was fulfilled by the subplots which spread everyone apart, only to bring them together again... Hayden's acting was much better here. I think people who say that he's still as bad as he was in AotC need to leave their bias at the door. His casting paid off for this film. Other than that, there isn't too much else to say, or defend I guess, about this film. Everything people complained about, whether it was Angstikin Skywalker or Politics are Humdrum seems to have been swept away, allowing for a more serious in nature film that was still open to some humor, even if it was ill-placed again. Also, I forget his name, Ian maybe, but Palpatine was frikken amazing. He could play both the stoic manipulator or the cackling bad guy, and was clearly having loads of fun in this role. Props to him. My only other complaint is that, like AotC, it seemed fake. I think there were more real sets here than in AotC, but certain rooms and visuals were like magic eye tricks. Palpatine's office, for example, was very wonky looking for several scenes. I hat noticing that feet are not actually walking where they're supposedly walking. Or seeing six clone troopers doing the same animation simultaneously. "

False,0,"I didn't hate jar jar. However, I wasn't complaining that he became more of a background character in Ep2 and 3"
False,0,"I agree Rex, like I didn't hate them Bc Star Wars but the acting wasn't amazing but I still like them and I agree jar jar stinks "
False,0,"Nope, work isn't finished. There's a huge gap between Crucible and Legacy in 130 ABY. And Bakura is definitely better than Aftermath, that book is an abomination.
As for Death Star insanity, you are right, but this Starkiller Base in TFA is pretty much Death Star inside the planet :P
Rebels are also 9yo kid stuff and very predictable, nobody ever dies. In EU, important characters died. It's bad they hadn't balls to kill off more OT characters than only Chewie (well, Luke died later, but we don't know how).
And EU had an outer enemy - Yuuzhan Vongs, no matter if you like them or hate them. Disney will be only Rebels/Republic vs Empire/First Order + Sith. Nothing more."
False,1,"From above:  Complaints about the EU (post ROTJ)
1.  Until Rouge squadron, every was Han/Luke/ Leia coming up against one Fate if The Galaxy after another . . . After a while it got stale, repetitive, and predictable

2.  Kevin J Anderson and damn near every thing he did about The Death Star, another Death Star, the laser of a Death Star down to IG88s downloading himself in the Death Star 

3.  Kevin J Anderson dissection every minute of the OT then either taking taking something or someone  insignificant and making them a major factor (i.e. The Ithorian from Mos Eisley) or going back to every location . . . I mean the Wampas in the abandoned  Hoth base and the ""leader"" having one arm??  Come on, that's 9yo kid stuff

4,  Truce of Bakura, Crystal Star. . . Need I comment on those?

As I said in another post, the EU served an important role and there may of not been 1-3 or the new trilogy without them.  But there work here is finished and it's time to move along "
False,1,"TrueRavenclaw616: That's just bandwagoning. Every EU hater knows that EU was the big convoluted mess full of bland characters and continuity errors, and they are all glad it is gone. And there are Vongs in it, what a mess, and they killed Chewie!"
False,2,"I wish it were canon, but I'd be willing to accept it being non canon if and only if new books, like the sword of the jedi trilogy, continued to be made, and I won't read or watch anything from the new canon until they are.

False,0,Sounds great. Thanks for the info.
False,0,"I'll be getting that too (I love Alan Dean Foster). In canon, I really like Lords of the Sith, Lost Stars, and Battlefront: Twilight Company.

False,0,Way too much PC and GC... Herkily jerkily... Meh.
False,0,"I find it interesting to learn about different characters, in this case, Wedge's apparition was great, but I don't like the introduction of many characters because they are characters we don't know more about.

False,0,It's present tense? Didn't know that... Yikes... 
False,1,"I won't tell anyone not to read/listen to it, but I will say it's a bit to PC for my taste and makes more departures from 1-6 than additions "
False,0,"However, I really liked Rae Sloane, the flashbacks/PTSD moments, and the interlude segments. Also, Norra being retconned into Return of the Jedi gave me an excuse to rewatch the Battle of Endor. No complaints there!"
False,3,"I can't speak for others, but I disliked the majority of characters, I felt the plot was uninteresting, and I didn't care for the present-tense writing style. It's the first in a trilogy and just couldn't really stand on its own.

False,0,"^By ""tiers of canon"" I was referring to G-canon, T-canon, C-canon, etc., but your post is still true."
False,0,"Canon, non-canon, EU, non-canon in EU... There are many layers. For example, if there's a story about Ezra finding Superman, it is non-canon, because it features Rebels character. It can't be EU non-canon, because Ezra is official Dysnei canon. Do you understand, padawan?
For EU non-canon, Revan being female is the example."
False,1,The tiers of canon apply only to Legends (the official continuity before April 2014).
False,0,"Last time I checked there are actually different levels of canon, see canon article on this wiki."
False,0,Thanks! :D
False,2,"Canon is the official story of Star Wars. This includes the Episodes, The Clone Wars and Rebels TV shows, and any books/comics released after April 2014. Non-canon is anything that is not a part of Canon."
False,0,Totally agreed with AV-6R7. Don't let the young adult label fool you - there are many great young adult novels out there. Lost Stars is one of them.
False,0,"The people that label the genres usually base their decision on past books by the author. Though Claudia Grey aimed it for Young Adults, it was more of a classic Star Wars story. So far it is my favorite canon novel. Definitely worth the read in my opinion"

False,0,"The empire wasn't perceived as evil. They were portrayed as though they were making a difference in the galaxy. And personally, I don't think that the empire was evil, it was however led by evil and those who followed his orders did so with the belief they were good. "
False,0,"The empire seems evil from our perspective, but people in the STAR WARS universe don't necessarily see it that way."
False,1,"In Disney's Rebels TV series and Jason Fry's Servants of the Empire novellas, the Empire sets up a vast network of Imperial Academies including one on the Outer Rim world of Lothal. The Lothal Imperial Academy is a junior one-year academy that takes teenagers. There are also senior academies like the Arkanis Academy. There are also officer training academies run by the Imperial Army, Navy, and Stormtroopers. Most of the clones have died out. Most of the recruits are patriotic human boys and girls. It is unclear if the Empire is still xenophobic but Jason says that it is no longer misogynistic. "
False,1,"Some were conscription I think, especially form the outer rim and mid rim worlds."
False,2,"When Palpatine took over, it was slowly and legitimately. When the Empire was born, Palpatine was at the height of his popularity. The Clone Wars were over, the Galactic economy was on the rise, life was good for many citizens. It wasn't until a good decade after that people started realizing that the empire wasn't such a good idea. Even Han was trained as a pilot in the Imperial Navy. 
So aside from the various clones, the majority of people who were Stormtroopers by BBY were just very patriotic citizens. One of Leia's notes in ""The Imperial Handbook"" states that most members of the Scout regiment were actually in it for the adventure and had no idea what the info they gathered was being used for."
False,2,"Well, I would say that the type of people that would enlist would either be: people trying to make a little money for their family, really patriotic patrons, people that crave action and war, and people that were forced to join the Empire."
False,1,"Well, the Empire kept on producing clones, and this can be seen in the book Allegiance by Timothy Zahn (Great book). This took place in 0 ABY, and in it he says he hated when humans enlisted, and said he preferred using clones instead. No need to spoil it further. 

Anyways, majority of the enlistee's that joined the Empire were patriotic young adults from the core, reason for this was because the core worlds were where Imperial citizens had it good and didn't see the atrocity of the Empire. 

Vader's 501st consisted of the best stormtroopers (both clones and non clones throughout the Imperial Stormtrooper Corps). "
False,1,pretty much anyone. the only pure clones in the empire was the 501st which was basically vaders body guards
False,0,It's a good Star Wars book that's like a transition between Return of the Jedi and TFA
False,1,"Aftermath is a highly, first installment of a trilogy,  anticipated glorified fan fiction novel written by the great author no one's heard of, Chuck Windig. The best thing about the book, is that the cover would make a cool poster.

Or am I just reaching and to lazy to look up the answer?"
False,0,"Bane brings up a good point, but I gotta agree with TK. The only reason Vader doesn't use force lightening is because he'll short out. However, Vader could block it with his lightsaber."

False,0,"I always saw the title ""Return of the Jedi"" as Anakin returning to being a Jedi at the end of the movie but so many people insisted on it being about Luke. On the face of it, yes (as otherwise you'd know how the movie ends!) but after watching the film, that was my interpretation of the title. 

Balance was restored by Anakin. "

False,0,If ur like me you think meh about Star Trek just because ur a Star Wars fan.
False,0,I'm scared I hope not...
False,2,"If Michael Bay, Peter Jackson, or even M Night Shamala were behind it. I would be hating so much. But JJ is one of the few directors I still hold respectable and think he can do it right. Remember Star Trek? Or Fringe? "
False,2,I have... A New Hope for this movie
False,1,"They spent $200 million on it, they'd wanna hope it is good!"
False,1,"Mace would, but what we know about Luke might change by the end of this week and we could have another out look on the fight."
False,1,Mace! 
False,1,Luke uses the dark side of the force frequently (sith force choke)  so Mace Windus Vaapad would get pretty damn powerful. 
False,2,It depends on what time frame we are using of Luke and Mace both.
False,2,"I believe Mace would win. Although Luke has more potential as a Force-user, Mace has had more Force training and more combat experience."
False,1,Luke would get absolutely destroyed. 
False,1,I think that Luke skywalker would be able to defeat mace windu because maces vapad only work when it draws dark energy from people who use the darkside 
False,1,Mace with that Vaapad
False,1,"Mace, he's a master of form 7."
False,1,"Exactly. I like to write Star Wars stories, and I want to make up a couple planets, just for the fun of it, and because, as many have said, it's more fun that way."
False,2,"^I'm one of those people. In a galaxy with thousands of planets, why would you want to see the same ones over and over again?"
False,2,Some people are complaining that they keep recycling planets.
False,0,"Yup I wish they would have used Tatooine too, hope there's something great about that planet, a good reason to not use Tatooine"
False,2,Part of me wishes they would of stuck with existing planets.
False,2,"Not really. Obvious similarities aside, the two planets have very different social structures and galactic roles. Besides, who wouldn't hate living in a desert? :P"
False,0,White 
False,0,"Blue, violet or green"
False,0,Blue but I'd want yellow with a curved hilt.
False,0,Blue is most common. I prefer orange 
False,0,I'd want orange or a dark wine color red
False,0,Black. Yellow. Purple. Turn to Dark side. Have sex. Use Red. 
False,1,I would say blue (on both accounts).
False,0,Muun are the guys who run the banking clan. Plagueis died. Sideous made sure of that.
False,0,Would be awesome if true!!
False,0,Hi
False,0,Very possible that our Munn Friend cheated death. 
False,0,Plus Tarkin book references Darth Plagious book a lot.
False,1,"Palpatine never upholds the rule of two very well. Plagious is never confirmed dead. Plus I think this should finally let Disney take on ownership of 1-3. Disney avoids them like black ""plagious"" lol jk but not"
False,0,It's jar jar
False,0,Mesa not a Sith Lord!
False,0," Brucewhelan, It's been confirmed the Jar Jar is not in the movie."
False,0,S/o to T1D2 bc I was thinking the same thing. A lot of sith have been able to over come death but only darth plaguous could for life. But that would be a good ass eye opener for the fans!!!
False,0,"Boba hasn't been in any of the trailers, but Captain Phasma had a brief shot. She has a very Boba look to her"
False,0,In which part and trailer man? 😂
False,0,In the trailer I swear I saw boba feet
False,0,They hinted a few times in aftermath. Dengar says that he sees him and they find a set of Mandalorian armor in one of the Tatooine scenes. I am guessing he lived and ditched the armor since he is easily recognized with it on. An armor-less Boba could walk through Jabba's palace and not be noticed. Easy to pick out that Beskar in a crowd.
False,1,"We don't know yet. In Aftermath it's hinted that Boba got out, and the trailer for Battlefront hinted at that as well, but we'll just have to wait and see."
False,0,"No, many Jedi used for choke. As long as you don't kill out of hatred you're okay. "
False,0,"Actually, both force lightening and force choke aren't necessarily a part of the dark side. What defines the dark side and the light is what emotions you use to achieve a desired effect of the force. For instance, Plo Koon invented a type of force lightening that used feelings of justice and duty, while sith force lightening is created using hate and anger. It's the same with the force choke, however, I doubt that Luke was feeling good emotions at that time, rather annoyance."
False,0,"Chaissus has a point. Though only Dark Side users are more commonly known for force chocking, Vader the most famous. There isn't really anything about it that defies it as Dark or Light side, only what is in the users heart. 

Force lightning is definitely a sith thing though, I recall it was named Sith Lightning at some stage"
False,0,Never knew force choke was only limited to the dark side.
False,0,Very true!  Even though Luke Is a powerful force user and is for the good of things.  If he dabbled in the dark side of the force too much it's extremely possible it consumed him.  Anakin for example.  
False,1,"While I doubt the rumors about Luke going dark, that moment in ROTJ has always made me wonder."
False,0,No that was a theory but no.
False,0,I agree
False,0,"True, but the episodes in S2 still feel too short. While if they were more 2 part episodes, the stories could be bigger"
False,1,"I don't see the point really. The Clone Wars was an anthology-based series, so story arcs were mandatory, but Rebels is one giant continuation. Each episode builds off of the previous one."
False,0,"I dont think theyre gong to make a third TFU, because the first two were declared non canon."
False,0,It does sound like a video game and the force unleashed three was hinted at
False,0,Though 2 definitely was good. It did deliver short. And that whole dark side bonus thing at the end was just weird and that was the moment that really ruined it for me
False,0,"It is, but I loved the first one, and was absolutely heartbroken at how disappointing two was. "
False,0,It's a shame when a story is left untold
False,0,"Well now that u mention it, actually yeah"
False,0,I'm sure the story would allow a 3rd...but I don't thing the 2nd did well enough. 
False,0,"I agree that TFU2 lacked atmosphere, but it ended with Vader being captured like they had a 3rd one planned"
False,0,"Probably not, I thought 2 kind of sucked...."
False,1,yeah it really does 
False,0,"Sorry, I don't think it's possible."
False,0,A working one

False,2,Yoda
False,2,No I was taking about on the show. 
False,1,"Also, if you saw her in the live action movies on Geanosis, that was Shaak Ti, not Ahsoka"
False,3,"The Clone Wars TV series fills the gap between Episodes II and III. The reason she was on Geonosis is because a second battle was fought there following the events of Episode II, after Anakin received her as his Padawan. More info can be found at http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano."
False,0,"Another reason ob1 won was because maul trained his entire life to fight specifically jedi, then in a fit of rage ob1 comes in fighting like maul, whereas dooku is trained in makashi, which is a more generalist duelling form. Dooku would win."
False,0,"Dooku would win, maul doesn't even have force lightning rofl 😈"
False,1,Long fight. But doku would win at the end
False,1,Mauls overconfidence is his weekness. That's why Ob1 defeated him. Dooku could take him easily 
False,1,Dooku's age would also be a weakness in a duel. Maul would cut through that slow old man.
False,2,Count dooku is smarter and a master swordsman
False,1,Darth Maul. I belive he is more skilled in swordplay than Dooku
False,0,That would be one to watch !
False,1,I think it would be darth maul because I do not know Kylo rens information
False,0,"Dark Disciple is canon, and part of The Clone Wars Legacy project. Along with Darth Maul son of Dathimer, Crystal Crisis on Utapu, which would have been the second half of S6. And The Bad Batch which would have been the first 4 episodes of S7. Dark Disciple was going to be after that"
False,1,It was originally gonna be in season 7 of The clone wars. The story reels on. YouTube 
False,1,*April 2014
False,1,Yes. Everything released after April 2015 that's not part of something legends is canon.

False,0,How the hell are they still alive?
False,0,"He has his own spin off film in a few years time, might appear at the end in slave 1 like a marvel credit scene, so it's possible "
False,0,I doubt it; it wouldn't be relevant to the plot and would just bog down the story. Perhaps he'll show up in Rogue One or the Han Solo film.
False,0,I wish but I don't think so since he would be pretty old and I personally would want my boba fett experience to end while he's still young and cool
False,0,That would be cool!!
False,0,I hope so
False,0,"Well, not contradictory... Ahsoka isn't the same as she was in TCW. And yeah, it's really watered down, so simpletons can understand it."
False,0,Only a few good legends exist and even fewer are true.
False,1,I love legends 
False,1,I hate Canon. it is a monstrosity.
False,1,It will change because the Canon stories are just starting out while there was some 40 odd years of legends.
False,0,"I think with legends, not everyone reads them and all that so you can't just have a movie on it without the audience being aware of what's happening/happened.."

False,0,When Rey announces herself as a jedi. I'm willing to bet that she will have a double lightsaber. So the staff she is carrying is simply training her how to weild a double lightsaber
False,0,"I do believe that Rey is the main Jedi, but Kylo will last long because of his power. He is resistant to the light side of the force"
False,0,Agreed. I kinda feel that Kylo might just be a fanatical guy obsessed with Vader bc snow was interested in Vader. I think a lot of back story on smoke will be revealed and Kylo with be one of those villains that is dangerous bc he is sociopathic and has the resources.
False,0,I think Kylo will grow in strength until he becomes a force to reckoned with. Rey Wii grow stronger also.
False,0,I'm a fan fiction writer. But Star wars is something I dare not touch because of the highest respect that I have for the ever growing franchise

False,0,"Ben Kenobi acknowledged R2 like their could have been history. But R2 didn't acknowledge back. That could either be because of a memory wipe, or the fact that Obi Wan had aged a lot.
Plus, R4 was Obi Wans droid, R2 was Anakins, maybe he spent little time with Obi wan during the prequels and clone wars. 

Maybe R2 did recognize Yoda, but without 3PO to translate, we never know what he said. 

And I don't recall the droids ever facing Vader. Face to face. So maybe Vader didn't know that they were the same droids, while the droids wouldn't have recognized Anakin"
False,0,They had a memory wipe. 
False,0,One idea is that he purged his memories of the Jedi (at least the visual data) thinking he wouldn't see them again and was unnecessary. Or maybe he does remember and we just don't see it.
False,0,R2 has been through far worse then getting shot by a TIE Fighter without any apparent memory loss.
False,1,"Yeah and when Ben kenobi found R2 on tattooine he didn't seem to recognise them, neither did Vader (Anakin)"
False,0,"Maybe when R2 was being fixed after the Battle of Yavin he lost some of his memory. I mean yes he has been shot a few times before, but not by a laser blast from a ship. It could have some more damage to his system"
False,4,Only C-3P0 got his memory erased. Any other in-universe suggestions?

False,0,Not a Sith =/= Not powerful.
False,0,They thought the same thing about Vader. Luke still sensed good in him. Darkness cannot overcome the light 
False,0,Kylo is proved powerful because he can use the force and is immune to the light side of the force

False,0,General grievous wasn't a Sith and if you have seen Star Wars the clone wars tv serious and the third movie you will know that you don't have to be a Sith to be very powerful

False,0,"If Disney brings out another star wars show, it will probably be a serious one rather than a preschool aimed show. As far as I'm aware, if characters die in a cartoon, it can be for grown ups and that makes it a serious show. 
For the record, the LEGO ones are a joke in my opinion and have no canon legitimacy. 

I don't think another show by Filoni's team will come out while Rebels lives. Though another team may pop up and bring a new star wars show with a brand new design"

False,1,"AceLM92: ""it makes Revan and the KotOR still canon as well""

It's actually the opposite of that. Until something is specifically mentioned as being canon, it should be considered Legends. That's why novels and games are being re-released with a new ""Legends"" banner - everything (not from the films or the Clone Wars) pre-April 25, 2014 is Legends unless otherwise stated."
False,0,OK that's kinder cool I love the PT the way it is but I get where your coming from want anakin to show his true power and skill but how will order 66 coming to play
False,0,Sorry for typos.. Autocorrect isn't my friend.
False,0,"Honestly I wish they would just redo the prequels and change up the storey a little bit. The way Anakin turned to the dark side it's stupid and probably was the most disappointing part of them to me. I think the first movie should be wiped, star with Anakin being a bad ass Jedi who is reckless but efficient, much like the clone wars show.  The second movie he turns to the dark side by the end: not because of love because that's ridiculously stupid, but because he sees that he can become more powerful faster, which he wants to do because padme gets murdered (by the emperor but he frames the Jedi council.) and he wants revenge.  The third movie he it's Darth Vader and just goes on a Jedi killing spree. Boom. Not that hard and way more satisfying for fans. You're welcome."
False,0,OK thanks for clearing that out so what about the PT.

False,0,"Even though Luke and Leia didn't know it, they shared a Force bond since they're both twins and Skywalkers.

False,1,I agree. Force telepathy is strong in those who posses an affinity to the Force
False,0,I think he was just calling for anyone and she just happened to sense him needing help

False,1,"I think Yoda regardless of age. 

I'm not particularly knowledgeable on the different forms of fighting but I think Anakin's arrogance cost him the fight against Obi-Wan. The only reason Obi-Wan lasted as long as he did (I believe) is that he trained Anakin so would know how to counter his moves. 

Obi-Wan tells Anakin that he could be as good a swordsman as Yoda (suggests that he see Yoda as better with a lightsaber).

He beat Grievance by shooting him rather than lightsaber battle although he held his own. "
False,1, since kenobi was able to defeat general grevious a infamous Jedi killer and pre darth Vader anakin skywalker one of the most powerful people in the Jedi council I believe that he would be able to defend against yodas attacks and counter with his own offensive stradegy

False,1,"It's been explicitly stated that he isn't a Sith, but there's nothing to suggest he's a Jedi either. He instead seems to be part of a faction separate from both called the Knights of Ren, although he might be the only force-sensitive member. "
False,0,"I am willing to give the new Canon a chance. The legends timeline had some good stuff to be sure. But not all of it was good and it sometimes tended to contradict itself or rehash the same things. I'm hoping that the new Canon can change things up a bit. Maybe show that the ""light side"" isn't always ""good"" and the ""dark side"" isn't always ""evil"""
False,2,"I'm sure we will. Just looking at The Force Awakens, 
I'm willing to bet characters like Kylo and Phasma will be just as iconic/popular among fans.

And to the above post, true Star Wars fans should be critical of the franchise, but give credit where due. With that said, the new canon's got my support."
False,0,New canon is bullshit. Legends is true Star Wars canon to real fans 
False,0,"Dethstyx, you can find them on YouTube. The latest one is called Sacrifice, I believe. Just type in Star Wars The Old Republic and they should have all the mini movies together on that channel. Enjoy!! "
False,1,"Hi Force User 7899, question, that sounds awesome, can I find those shorts on YouTube, Google, or? Is there a specific place I should go to, thank you in advance!"
False,1,Would be awesome.
False,1,I think it would be cool. We would get many new sith and jedi that weren't so known before
False,1,The rumored Netflix original star wars series could be around the old Republic era. Either that or the anthology films. They have to acknowledge the era further with Darth Bane in the Canon
False,3,I agree there mini shorts are amazing
False,0,"I'm sure there are connections, but I don't like thinking about it (I want to be 100% surprised when I see the movie). Less than 10 days away!"
False,0,Boba Fett should appear in Han's stands alone film in my opinion. They have a history of being frienemies. 
False,0,How will Han get a movie tho? I'm like so confused! Would H. ford play him still? Because he's getting old and I kinda would rather see a prequel which won't happen.
False,0,"I agree, I was just wondering whether the bounty hunter movie will be set during the empire or after these new movies"
False,1,"The Han Solo origin movie is a go, it is highly likely that Boba will be one of them. But I think that Greedo will have a role in the Han movie"

False,0,"Because as we all know well Disney has never made anything even remotely enjoyable! Come on folks. Besides, Disney's barely involved in the Show's production. Hell, half the people working on it created ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars""."
False,1,Am I the only person who seems to not watch Rebels? My reason is simple. It is Disney.
False,0,I was kinda hoping there would be a big prison break of some sort but I'm  ok with it sticking with the feels 
False,0,Eeyup 
False,1,It was a really good episode 
False,0,Oh yay. More Rebels. What joy. 
False,1,Hopefully Star Wars rebels comes up with some along the lines of Game of Thrones' R+L=J theory to explain Ezra's family origins. 
False,2,Can't wait to learn what happened to his parents? It would be very interesting if they somehow ended up in the Game of Thrones universe. 
False,0,I'm so angry. Why did you mention it?

False,0,Sorry I do not know what 1313 is. Could you explain it to me?
False,0,Clones can use he force!?! Wtf? That can't be right 
False,0,"I dunno maybe

False,0,"Clone troopers are not stormtroopers. Fynn isn't a clone, he's just force sensitive"
False,0,^ This 
False,2,"X1 and X2 were Clone Troopers, though not cloned from Jango Fett, but rather the Jedi Falon Grey. X1 went on to make one of the many splinter factions of the Empire after the Battle of Endor, and became a Sith Lord. X2 had, however, joined the Rebellion and became a Jedi, one of the many trained by Luke Skywalker directly. He later killed his brother on Mustafar when he attempted to make a clone army of Skywalker.
http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/X1
http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/X2
These are now, however Legends. The game's plot was quite nice, really, even if the gameplay was terrible. Once again I find myself blaming Disney for this."
False,0,I think it would be a pretty good idea.
False,0,Well we have a storm trooper becoming a Jedi in the force awakens. So maybe
False,0,I don't think that concept will come into play in the New canon
False,0,Uh. No. 
False,0,"Well, it was already a video game. It was okay. "
False,0,Leia was definitely a trained Jedi Knight in the EU. 
False,0,I don't no I don't really pay attention to EU plz don't hate
False,0,"She does not train in the ways of the jedi, but is still force sensitive. In TFA she is a general and no longer the princess of a planet that exploded a long time ago. "
False,0,In the EU she becomes almost as powerful as Luke.
False,0,I hope so.
False,0,"Technically, the EU was canon. Go read Wookieepedia if you don't know that :-)
But who the hell cares about canon and non-canon, canon is what you like!"
False,0,"The Solo kids, I assume you're speaking of Jacen/DarthCadeius & Jaina? Yeah that's been pushed aside to 'Legends' (non-canon), And, even though the film makers, producers, etc. do their very best to keep everything strictly confidential, except obviously what we see from the trailers/teasers, & toys, in those which they've allowed us to see, there's nothing in them at all whatsoever pertaining to the original Solo family or any legends stuff. Basically after the sale, of Lucasfilm Ltd. from George to Disney, first they pushed whatever they wanted over to (Ledends) , & hired writers, & screen-writers to pen entirely new scripts, to continue from after Return of Jedi, moving forward. And also all of the stuff that is now ""filling in the blanks"" so to speak...for ex. the time periods after the events of Epusode III, in bet that & ep IV, etc. and then actually, I just realized myself while typing this, the fact that Clone wars series is Canon, that was actually started off by Lucas, that might be the only extra Lucas material they've kept, yeah so Series:Clone Wars seasons 1-6, and lastly in regards to me speaking of ""filling in blanks"", I guess what's left is.. SW Rebels.& the newer novels and comics/graphic novels. "
False,1,"Disney has utterly ruined my Star Wars world, even if it is still up to me what to believe and what not to believe."
False,0,He made Star Wars. His right only dissipated when he sold to Disney. 
False,2,Lucas has yet to earn the right to claim Star Wars. He made a few movies. The EU made a galaxy. 
False,0,"The solo twins are a concept from the EU.  The EU is no longer canon, and technically, never was. In the eyes of Lucas, only his movies were canon, which is something few people seem to understand. I have nothing against the EU, I enjoyed the Empire comics and the Legacy comics. And still think of many of those stories as worth being official canon."
False,0,Darn. Okay thanks
False,0,From what has been released they don't. 
False,0,"Damn!! Did I see someone noted that there's approximately 400 million planets that have life?,I the SW Galaxy/galaxies??!! Sheesh! Where do I find that? Can I look on one of these apps or could I find that sort of info in the many books out in B & N for instance?"
False,0,Not exactly. Similar. You can even say Chewbaka is a kind of dog. All of the creatures made by LucesArts  comes from a animal in our world.
False,0,Probably 
False,0,http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dog/Legends
False,0,"There is quite a bit of references to dogs in the EU, so you could say that yes there are dogs in Star Wars."
False,0,"There are over 400 million inhabited planets in the galaxy, and many more that support life. Yes, I think it's safe to say, there are dogs. Not even counting the countless canoid species. "
False,2,"I believe the EU did have some straight up dogs. I don't know if NuCanon has used them yet, but like Rex said, with the fact that Marrok exists (Embo's pet) it's possible that other dog like mammals exist, including things very similar to dogs, if not outright dogs. "
False,0,"Embo has a pet dog wolf thing. Plus there is the Wolf Pack, so I'd imagine there are some wolves and dogs in the universe.... somewhere"
False,0,"Several kinds of dog-like creatures. Massifs, Kath Hounds, Anoobas, Akk Dogs...the list probably goes on."

False,0,I cried 😢
False,1,"A sad episode to be sure, but I'm hoping this will drive Ezra back towards the light, as he definitely displayed some dark side tendencies prior to and during the Empire's assault on Garel City. A good ending to the first act of Rebels' second season."
False,0,HAHAHA. I could list things all day and you still wouldn't have a complete timeline. 
False,0,"The movies? In terms of when each event happened, it goes in the episodic order. So: Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. The Force Awakens happens 30 years after ROTJ."
False,0,Copy cat 🐱.... Just kidding👍🏻
False,0,"^I like that explanation for my personal canon-records lol. Losing so much good canon because of Disney. Hopefully this is an opportunity to create some even BETTER, more consistent canon for this wonderful universe. "
False,1,"Not entirely true. In addition to the Jango clones, the Empire commissioned clone batches from countless other templates, both from Kamino and other sources. By the Battle of Yavin, one third of the Stormtrooper Corps was a clone of some sort. "
False,0,"The Stormtroopers were not clones. In the very early days of the Empire, the clone troopers served as the first generation of Imperial Stormtroopers, but were eventually phased out. By the time of A New Hope, the Stormtrooper Corps are made up of human enlists, not clones of Jango Fett.

Also, it's the First Order, not the New Order. :~)"
False,3,"In response to your question, the clone troopers are eventually phased out by normal human recruits who are trained at various Imperial Academies throughout the galaxy. Disney's Star Wars Rebels series and John Fry's Servants of the Empire novella series deals with that topic. After the Empire was created, the clone troopers were renamed Stormtroopers and the Jango Fett clones grew old and were replaced. Btw, the First Order is not directly descended from the Empire but is an organization that admired the Empire. Think of them as neo-Nazis."
False,1,"I feel that Finn could be killed off near to the end of the film or at the start of EP VIII, just to give the whole new trilogy a new spin on things, at the moment TFA just seems to be like a reimagined and more up to date version of a new hope...."
False,1,"An AWOL Stormtrooper with fencing lessons under his belt isn't a terrible premise. It's like trying to be a Jedi without the use of the Force, putting you at a disadvantage forcing you to be smarter than your foe in several ways. Alternatively, Boyega might be a decoy protagonist who gets killed in the end. Liam Neeson took up a sizable chunk of the TPM poster, after all. Of course you can argue his legacy had a big affect on the remaining prequels, but with that said, he was still killed off before the prequel story even began. "
False,0,All that we know is that Mark Hamill will be acting as Luke Skywalker in the film. Have to wait and see what happens to John Boyega and Daisy Ridley.
False,0,No.  It would be an interesting twist tho
False,0,"Because of what Luke stood for. I believe it is more likely that Kylo Ren is a clone of Anakin, than Luke turned evil. I mean just look at the shot in the trailer with Kylos hair?  Looks a little like III Anakin. "
False,1,"In my opinion, Kylo has no affiliation with Luke. I think that Luke will be acting sort of how Obi-wan did in A New Hope. I think a major plot point in TFA will be Han Solo helping the two new characters find Luke to be trained in the ways of the force. More evidence that Luke is NOT Kylo is because of how his lightsaber looks. From what we've seen, the beam of the lightsaber isn't very solid and it appears to be made by someone who hasn't had any training in making a lightsaber. This piece of evidence is a little less solid but I think it's valid for speculation.
"
False,0,"Kylo is not Luke as they are different actors ;) but yes, it would have been sweet. Mark Hamill is Luke while Adam Driver is Kylo"
False,0,I hope that Kylo is Luke.
False,0,Yes I think Kylo is his apprentice personally 
False,0,"How old would Yoda have been when he was a padawan? He says he is 800 years old in ep.V.

If Wookies live to be 400 years then Yoda would of been 300 something years old if Wookies remembered him as a padawan.

Ironic since Yoda claimed Luke was too old to train right?

"
False,0,Bowdaar was also few centuries old in SWTOR
False,0,The EU is no longer canon
False,0,"The problem with Chewbacca appearing it episode 7 is that in the EU he has died several years BEFORE hand. If this is Chewbacca from episode 4,5,6 and 3 (yes he makes a appearance in Episode 3 ) then that would mean this film does NOT tie in with Star Wars EU. I personally don't think that works with the Star Wars storyline."
False,0,"You could just check the Wookie article. Note the name WOOKIEpediea. But several hundred years is about right. Chewy was about 200 in the OT. Before the fall of Kashyyyk, there were some living Wookies that remembered as far back as when Yoda was a Padawan. "
False,0,This is the wiki look it up 
False,1,400 years
False,0,They typically live for centuries.
False,0,"Real reason for the green color is lighting/filming issues. They had a hard time capturing that piercing blue color against the sky when Jabba is sentencing Luke, Han, and Chewie. Canon-wise, it's what everyone said above. "
False,1,Star Wars Episode 6 Return Of The Jedi.
False,1,"In Legends, Luke constructs his lightsaber in Shadows of the Empire, a multimedia series that bridges ESB and ROTJ. In Canon, we don't yet know the story. However, in Heir to the Jedi, a canon novel released early this year, Luke is given a lightsaber and disassembles it to see its workings; also, in a recent issue of the Star Wars comic, Luke and co. discover a loot of lightsabers. These points may be expanded upon in the future."
False,1,There was a deleted scene for ROTJ that shows how Luke got his green light saber
False,1,Why is Luke's saber green?
False,2,The reason why lukes lightsabor was green because it was a gift from yoda. But obviously its not yodas because in revenge of the sith when yoda duelled with chancellor palpatine his lightsaber was like half his size lol
False,1,Thanks very much ;)
False,1,"Cwendin, at what point did Luke assemble his lightsaber? Or was it a gift from Yoda?"
False,2,"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi
Fun Fact: Luke's green lightsaber was intended to be blue, but the color was changed during production."
False,1,Return of the jedi. Luke Skywalker uses a green lightsaber.
False,0,Clones
False,1,"It's not really as simple as that. While clone troopers and first-generation Stormtroopers all came from the same genetic stock, later generations of Stormtroopers were recruited humans from across the galaxy who trained in a variety of Imperial Academies, allowing for too many variables to really make a fare judgement. However, it is fairly obvious that not all Stormtroopers are created equal, so I personally believe that the Fett clones are overall the superior soldier."
False,1,Phase two clone also it depends on the storm trooper some are more skilled than other and same with the phase two clone
False,1,Certainly a phase 2 clone trooper. Rex comes back in Rebels Season Two and trounces several Stormtroopers in the recent episode Stealth Strike.
False,1,"I wasn't sure how new content was going to be handled, and frankly I haven't looked. But this is good to hear, Brandon. You guys are doing pretty damn good. "
False,1,A decision I personally agree with.
False,1,"The site couldn't be locked down completely otherwise the bot would not have been able to edit. So accounts with bot, admin, and staff rights are able to edit still.

False,0,I wonder the interaction between the 2 were deleted in the movie. I remember watching it in the theater and hearing how disappointed they were when the scene was never shown.
False,0,"Because he had no connection to Luke, whereas, both Ben Kenobi and Yoda both knew Luke before their deaths."
False,0,Maybe Kylo Ren hold the sacred position of The Mandalore? Hence the reason for their militant-like behavior? 
False,0,Doesn't Finn have Anakin's Lightsaber now?
False,0,Daaahlen is wrong on kylo fighting for the lightsaber because in episode 5 Luke drops anakin's/vader's lightsaber during his battle against Vader. Luke makes his own lightsaber. 
False,0,"It is said that he wears an ancient Mandalore helmet. This has no fact in it, and the idea comes from Darth Raven and how it looks like it. But Darth Raven not being canon, it's not Mandalore"
False,0,Or he is luke!!!
False,0,"kylo ren is a human from the knights of ren and is obsessed with collectibg darth vader artifacts (thus darth vaders burnt helmet in the trailer) which leads me to believe he might face off luke for his lightsaber (because it was originally anakin/vaders), although some people think luke has turned to the dark side, so ren might have turned luke to the dark side whilst trying to get his lightsaber"
False,0,"There is part of an article about that on this wiki. I believe it's under either ""Darth Vader"" or ""Sebastian Shaw"""
False,0,I thought to show him as anakin before he went to the dark side and became Darth
False,0,"""After he returned to the light?"" He returned to the light when he betrayed Palpatine and saved Luke. I think his Force Ghost should have absolutely been at his age as of RotJ, his redeemed form dying in Luke's arms."
False,0,"Because they show Anakin as a Jedi not as Vader, After he returned to the light and to Luke's father Anakin. It just to show his father as good. "
False,1,"It's to fit in with the continuity established in the first three films. To have Anakin look more like we saw him in the first three is great, but I much prefer the original cut myself. The unmasking scene also doesn't match when young Anakin is put into the 'ghost' shots. You might as well add Ewan MacGregor rather than Alec Guinness in that case.  "

False,1,^Twilight Company was fantastic.
False,0,"Not bad, not great. . . Agree on the characters not being likable (with the exception of the droid and the drathomirian chick) , in general it's way to ""PC"" for my preference.  Although I may like it more after the movie and other books come out.

I thought Battleftont was far better "

Therefore, we are left thinking:

-if Vader threw the dual as he was already coming back
-if the suit was failing already
-if Palpatine was influencing it

Etc etc "
False,0,"I don't think so. When Vader starts talking about Leia, he was clearly trying to upset Luke. And if he was holding back at all, it was probably to lure Luke to the dark side."

False,2,Whatchutalkinbout? Robot Chicken should be canon. 
False,0,"^Totally agree. Fun Fact: in a recent book series re-imagining the prequels to be Shakespearean, Jar Jar is in fact a mastermind pretending to be a fool. Also, Robot Chicken did the ""Jar Jar is a Sith"" thing long ago. Either way, both are strictly non-canon (hallelujah)."
False,1,"No, for a few reasons. First, it is canon that Jar Jar spent all but his childhood in Gunga city. There, it would have been impossible for him to learn the ways of the Force, much less be a Sith Lord and orchestrate the fall of the Republic with Sidious as a puppet. 
Second, regarding the theory's claim that Jar Jar's acrobatics can only be done by Force-Sensitives: Jar Jar is one of the most uncoordinated, clumsy Gungans out there. Rather than believe that he's a secret Sith because he can do some acrobatics, it's much more reasonable to think ""Gungans must have a natural agility in order to survive underwater"". 
Last, even IF George made Jar Jar the evil Sith Lord behind everything in a fit of his known weirdness, his ideas for the story of the new movies were largely scrapped. With J.J. Abrams being an outspoken critic of Jar Jar, it's very unlikely that we'll ever see him again."

False,1,"As Lucasfilm themselves have stated, ""Legends"" sometimes hold some truth. And indeed, some good things from ""Legends"" are re-entering Canon, mostly via Star Wars Rebels and its tie-in media (novels, comics, etc.).

So yes, considering Legends as quasi-Canon is indeed not wrong, and a good source for speculating into New Canon. In fact, it's a very fun game to guess which Legends elements will get ""recanonized"" next :-)"
False,1,I think the Original Eu will eventually fade away i will still read and love it but will not argue about which is better.

It's to the benefit of the site's readers and Star Wars fans in generals to make this change, rather than stick to a Legends-default system that's for the benefit of only a few hardcore Legends fans."

False,0,Rant over. 
False,1,"I miss the EU. I don't see Star Wars as something mildly entertaining to read and watch on occasion. I see it as what it is, an enormous, fully constructed universe, that you can just lose yourself in. It has so much depth and character. Every background character has a name and story. Every starship and weapon has a story. EVERY KRIFFING FOOD SOMEONE EATS HAS INFORMATION ABOUT IT. But that's all changed. Disney's extended the reach of the megacorps outside of the Star Wars galaxy into our own. And now all Star Wars is is another way for them to line their coffers. "
False,0,You and I must be pretty similar. Everything about that sounds like me. 
False,1,Explain why SWTOR and everything before it are garbage. I find them to be the best parts.
False,0,Because SWTOR and much of the Post- ROTJ universe is garbage.
False,1,"As far as the article goes, the Wiki admins are currently separating the Legends content from the Canon content in order to clean up and organize the wiki before a butt load of new info comes in when The Force Awakens releases. So some parts of articles will be out of access for another few days.
    I wouldn't be too upset about the changing of EU Canon to legends. It's an effort to clean it up so new fans aren't overwhelmed, and Lucasfilm has gone on record stating that a lot of Legends material holds truth. That means you can believe whatever you want about what happened, it just may not necessarily be canon."
False,1,"Hi there, 

Disney established their own Star Wars continuity in order to give J.J. Abrams and other producers more flexibility and room to maneuver when producing the new Sequel Trilogy and other future films. Having spent my teenage years immersing myself in the world of the Expanded Universe, I can understand your frustration and angst. There were some outstanding elements of the old EU like the Thrawn Trilogy, Darth Bane, Knights of the Old Republic, and the Lost Tribes of the Sith stories. However, there were also a lot of plot continuity contradictions. One good example would be AOTC saying that the Republic is 1,000 years old while older EU literature like the Essential Chronology says that it is 25,000 years old. That's why some EU authors had to create the Ruusan Reformation to retcon this problem. Concerning your question about not being able to load the Legends part of the Coruscant article, bots are working on Wookieepedia to rearrange the website to emphasize the canon elements first. So there will be some disruption. "
False,0,In my opinion Clone Wars is a lot less childish then Rebels and is a bit easier to connect with the characters then it is for Rebels.   
False,0,Clone wars Rebels is to drawn out and the clone wars actually told a story that you read in book and I know both of them are but clone wars was canon and clone wars was better overall
False,0,"Clone Wars is much deeper and has better writing, but I like Rebels due to all new villians such as Inquisitors and the Seventh Sister as well as a return of a much stronger Ahsoka Tano. "
False,0,The only think about rebels it is a bit to kiddish 
False,0,That R both amazing 
False,0,Loved clone wars but rebels is growing on me
False,0,Both are great. But best start with clone wars for spoiler reasons. Aka Fulcrum
False,0,Rebels in my opinion is better so far. Clone Wars is still great but Ezra is so cool and seeing a character progress and get more powerful over time is better than a character being powerful from the start and never progressing. Chopper and Zeb are also awesome. 
False,0,The animation for Rebels makes it look like some kind of toddler's TV show.
False,2,"It's amazing how so many here love Clone Wars and dislike Rebels due to rose-colored tinted glasses of Nostalgia.

Clone Wars did not get great until S3 begins, and even then there are many filler episodes. The animation was -- to put it nicely -- ""interesting"", with plasticine faces and hair made out of cardboard.

I have the complete set of TCW, and I'm following SWR closely, and I can say with great honesty and without any persuasion, that SWR is better.

The story develops better. The animation is better. It is setting down a significant amount of New Canon. It opens up new storyline possibilities so we are not limited to the ""rail shooter"" that is the Numbered Episodes.

And it's just in its second season. Not yet 1.5 seasons has been aired, and many ""old school"" Star Wars fans -- including those who *actually* watched the Original Trilogy in the theaters -- are admitting, albeit sometimes begrudgingly, that it's a good show."
False,2,"The new canon sucks, in my opinion. Hate it."
False,2,"Basically, anything official ""Star Wars"" that was put out before April 25, 2014 is now considered ""Legends,"" save the six main movies, the Clone Wars film and the Clone Wars TV series. Those exceptions and everything official released after April 25, 2014 is considered canon, again with certain exceptions, such as a few things that are intentional continuations of Legends stories and certain comic material that is explicitly non-canon like ""Angry Birds: Star Wars."" And the reason it's so hotly debated is because a lot of people were fans of the old Legends stuff like Mara Jade Skywalker and the Thrawn books, and don't like that it's all essentially non-canon now."
False,1,"Put simply, Legends refers to all Star Wars media (novels, comics, TV shows, etc.) released prior to 2014. In 2014, Disney made the decision to reboot the Legends continuity, and announced that all upcoming media (i.e. Rebels, Episode VII) would form the new Star Wars canon. It's heavily debated because many fans were committed to the Legends universe, some for decades, and they feel the reboot is unfair to their commitment."
False,1,I hate the new canon to the point were I refuse to read or watch it. Even the new movies. The old EU was the golden days.
False,2,"While I dislike things such as the Yuuzhan Vong War, I love the Legends EU; it's the reason I became involved with Star Wars in the first place. However, the new universe is an incredible chance for better stories and a more cohesive narrative (plus it's really exciting to see it grow). All-in-all, I like both."
False,1,"Right? I honestly love the EU, it has plot holes but IMO they weren't huge. Dark Forces was amazing, along with Thrawn Trilogy, etc."
False,3,"The Old EU will certainly never die in terms of existing. I for one will always treasure the Dark Forces Saga. Now if someone found a way to simply destroy everything from the EU, like through raids or something, then we'd have a problem. "

False,1,"Why consider either non-canon? The easiest way to look at the legends and canon situation is to consider them separate continuities, both of which can co-exist. The Marvel comics have loads of separate continuities, many of which are fantastic.  "
False,0,You're very narrow minded Jace Onasi.
False,1,I consider everything in the new system that was not made before April 25th 2014 to be non-canon.
False,1,"That may be the original meaning for Legends, but with so many ""non-canon within the new canon continuity"" materials being released, it will be much easier to brand non-canon things as ""Legends"".

It's also a much shorter label: 41 characters versus 7 :-)"
False,1,"P.S. - technically, ""Legends"" is a marketing term, as is ""Infinities."" Wookieepedia considers anything from ""Infinities"" non-canon, but just because something is non-canon doesn't mean it's ""Infinities."" Same for ""Legends."""
False,1,"Not quite. Legends does not equal non-canon. For example, the ""Star Wars: Epic Yarns"" are listed as non-canon, but we don't call that ""Legends."" We list them as ""non-canon within the new canon continuity."" ""Legends"" is a term for material originating before April 25, 2014, which may include old non-canon material. But those non-canon stories may still have included stuff such as Mara Jade Skywalker which was part of the old ""Legends"" continuity. But if something goofy like ""Angry Birds"" or something includes Ezra Bird-er or something, that's just ""non-canon,"" not ""Legends."""
False,1,"Why absurd? If it's determined to be not part of Canon, it gets branded as ""Legends""; it's a designation for ""Non Canon"", not a simple rebranding of old EU.

The ""Legends"" label is a very good initiative to properly separate Canon Material with non-canon media."
False,0,Yes
False,0,Depends which side they are on...
False,0,"The reason why stormtroopers can't aim is because they were normal people trained by the empire. While clone troopers were genetically breed by kaminoans.

That's why the only stormtroopers who ever hit their mark were the ones at the beginning of A New Hope, Darth Vaders army"

Just read the latest Star Wars comics; you can see Han and Chewie wielding lightsabers. They are not Force sensitives. Of course, that means they wield them clumsily and just as some blunt weapons. And most likely won't be able to deflect incoming blasters shots.

But in a pinch, any individual -- Force sensitive or not -- can wield a lightsaber as a replacement for a baseball bat."
False,2,"If you read the article on midi-chlorians, it says that midi-chlorians can be used to keep an individual alive way past the point where they should have died (i.e. Keeping Grievous alive while transplanting only his vital organs into a new body), but the midi-chlorians don't enhance the individual's force-sensitivity.

False,0,There is a Visio game where kyle katarn steals it but that is non cannon now. Good news is that the new movie rogue 1 is about that so u will find out soon

False,0,"Inquisitors are a class of Sith, and they easily took Kanan and the others out, they both didn't look tired at all, give tano credit were its due "
False,0,"Those two were not Sith. They were Inquisitors.

And do bear in mind that the two had been fighting Zeb & Kanan for a good part of the episode, so they were already tired, while Ahsoka came in fresh."
False,0,Well like them and that alsome fight scene when she beat 2 Sith with double bladed sabers at the same time 
False,0,The had to make new ones because she couldn't take he old ones after she left the Jedi
False,1,"Dave Filoni says they're white to show that she isn't affiliated with the Jedi anymore. So visually they look awesome, plus they have symbolic meaning. I like 'em."

False,0,"It's still early days in the Disney reign, so they may take a while to get everything right. They may have got Windig on for Aftermath which was a bombshell, and made the bad decision to make his book a trilogy series in his contract. But at least they have a consistent story over all of the platforms. 

There are references throughout linking the books to the movies to the animated series to the comics and vice versa. 

Lost Stars was an amazing read. If you want to give a Canon novel a shot. Go for lost stars. You will never watch the Original trilogy the same way again"
False,0,Piece**
False,1,"Within ten years, haters of New Canon will be dwindling so much, while a new generation of Star Wars fans raised on The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels, and the Sequel Trilogy hold sway.

Do you really want to be negative to new canon material so much you risk being disconnected to the rest of the fandom? That will be your loss, you know?"
False,1,"Yay! Close minded negativity!! Come on people, I miss parts of the old EU too but let's at least try to be a bit more open minded."
False,1,I hate Disney as as a Star Wars fan 
False,0,Well I like tano and here white sabers 
False,0,"So far the Cannon stuff(granted that I've  only listened to all on audiobook) has been great.  My only issue is the ""PC"" aspect that has been introduced.  Primarily because Disney either fears backlash from the TwitterTweens, or to fit their other platforms.  But if you wanna stay true to the OT, there's not a lot of ""diversity"" in the Empire

That being said, like the EU, there's great stuff and some cheesy stuff.  However I think cannon is learning from EU mistakes like revisiting every location in the OT and exaggerated coincidences of  minor characters effects. . . Or the flat out stupid like IG88 being the cpu of the Death Star, so needless to say, it's a good thing they scrapped a lot of ur  "
False,2,"I've personally enjoyed most of the new canon works, and especially enjoy seeing stuff from the EU being brought into the new canon. I imagine the OT focus is mostly due to the build up for TFA, as the OT characters are going to be the ones appearing in the new film. Once we get to the anthology films and beyond I imagine we'll see whole range of eras explored by the new canon. "
False,1,"That said, I loved Tarkin(Really felt movie material) and The Weapon of a Jedi.

Shattered Empire was almost there but not quite. It felt obfuscated, disjointed and too short. Too much focus on action. It doesn't explain at all however how Luke even knew about what they were going after in Issue 4. It doesn't make much sense."
False,1,"I find myself surprised at the Disney canon I have read so far.

I do miss a ton of stuff from the old EU though. They treated it like it was insignificant and didn't matter. But had no problem raiding it's coffers for tons of things instead of coming up with new things in their place.

Which is a double edge sword.

What I really dislike though is the blatant pandering to the OT and it's small subset of vocal fans. 
The unwarranted and unrelenting bashing of anything that isn't the OT or the pre SE OT.

False,0,"Talkpages are only used to discuss improvements to the articles they are attached to, not who would win threads or fan theories."
False,0,"Yeah, but your articles have talk pages..."
False,0,Discussion is also on the Fallout wikia
False,0,"It's called Discussion, a new feature that is currently under development from Wikia that will eventual turn into a full-fledged forum. The reason this has been implemented is because we at Wookieepedia have no comments sections on our articles, and this is divorced from our main experience."
False,0,"The only spoilers that I have gotten from this wikia was what happened to Ventress in Dark Disciple. As for movie spoilers. The pages where those spoilers would be, are very vague or empty that they tell you nothing that could spoil. "
False,0,"@Dotsie spoilers != leaks.

Leaks happen when something is not yet made public, but someone got a hold of it, and made it public.

Spoilers happen when someone saw something already public, and posted about that also publicly into a community of which a part have not seen it.

Mark Hamill was requesting that, even though some people might be privy to un-released movies, please do not make them public out of schedule."
False,0,"Pages that have spoilers have a big spoiler template at the top, so if you don't want to be spoiled then be sure not to read those!"
False,0,Mark Hamill once said that he doesn't want anyone to leak the next film on the internet (see the article on The force Awakens.)
False,1,"The easy solution is to just avoid the wikia until you see the film. If you can't manage that, then all our pages related to the new film are marked with a special spoilers tag at the top warning you not to read them. There's no need to be concerned about the lockdown as it will only last a few days, after which editing will return as normal. "
False,0,I just don't read cannon articles which is pretty easy considering how many more legends articles there are 
True,1,"Well, this is a Wiki, where we include all spoilers. I am too, concerned about the lockdown, but mainly I just find that it is retarded, as I hate canon, and love Legends."

False,0,"I heard that rumor from the Colider Jedi Council. They think that A) he may return in a flash back, but star wars never has done flashbacks in the past. 
B) as a force ghost
C) as Darth Vader in Rogue One

I'm hoping on C"
False,0,"How would they bring him back though? At the end of his life he converged back to the light side. It is shown that the Sith can create matter out of Midi-chlorians (See Great Experiment) but Anakin manifests in the force. If he was to make a return would he have the knowledge to ""reincarnate"" in a sense? "
False,0,"I hope so TBH. It's funny how when this rumor started. People were all of a sudden ""Ok it's time to let Vader go"". So THAT's where they draw the line at pandering.

But really, if they do. I'll be glad. He wasn't ever a bad actor, EPII wasn't the best (Even though I enjoy it immensely). But based on his performance in EPIII, I welcome that they were willing to go for consistency and bring him back. Anakin Skywalker as a FG could never have been a middle aged man. Nor was Anakin Skywalker ever a Jedi as a middle aged man. It is as Obi-Wan said ""Darth Vader betrayed and murdered your father"". When the glint of light deep inside Vader finally awoke. Anakin Skywalker the Jedi was reborn. So the former visage of himself as a Jedi makes sense as a FG. "
False,0,"Yah, Portman wasn't too amazing in the prequels. Which is weird, because she has done great work in other films. I mean, I think TPM was sort of like near the start of her career, and her better films were later on. "
False,0,"He wasn't the problem in the sequels it was Portman, and the scripts.  I'm all for a false back or something similar in VIII and IX"
False,0,No but ive heard about ewan mcgregor wanne do more Work through star wars

False,1,"I don't think Kyle Katarn will ever make it to canon. Aspects of his story -- even including his romantic relation ship with a goggle-wearing pilot -- seems to have been absorbed, in part or in whole, into the character of Kanan Jarrus."
False,0,"I agree. I'm a new fan, and all that legends literally gave me a migraine the whole day. "
False,0,"I really like Caedus, one of my favorite Sith. But since they made him related to Luke it has to change. I would go crazy if it turned out Kylo was a version of Caedus. I doubt it though. I don't get why people like Katarn so much though. "
False,1,"I thought Finn was the new Kyle Katarn, both are storm troopers gone Jedi. So it makes sense."
False,0,"Ugh, don't remind me. He should've been a key character in Rogue One. If he is reduced to nothing more than a visual cameo or something in Disney Canon. I'll be one huge sad panda.

""But Caedus, Katarn, cloned emperor, all of that is gone. ""

And really only ONE of those things was worth getting rid of.

Caedus is Kylo Ren (Though with his character warped to suit their needs of a vessel for what those OT fans thought Anakin Skywalker was all along and not as TPM or the PT disappointed them. Always some kind of badass, strong in the darkside. Potentially inherently evil though he feels he is doing the ""right"" thing.)

Cloned Emperor, despite now at this point the plausibility of it. Was a strange storyline. Almost up there with turds like Aftermath and The Crystal Star."
False,0,Chances of Katarn returning to the new timeline are slim. But if it happened I would explode from the joy. 
False,3,"I actually like what disney did. The lore got messy because there was conflicting accounts and too much. This time they are rewriting it to make sense. People like Bane and Revan still count I think, because they are to important to cancel. But Caedus, Katarn, cloned emperor, all of that is gone. "
False,2,Don't think so. He is a Legends character. Blame Disney.

False,0,"I hope not but it seems to be that way. They seem to twist that to their own needs instead of keeping the characters the same and putting it into a new canon. (Because it's not like the OT enough. And you know they have to pander to that vocal minority of OT fans)

Rather than making Jacen a Vader like figure by Default and Rey the innocent naive girl from a desert planet. Aka making her the Luke like figure.

But that would make Qui-Gon stronger, because he trained Obi-Wan, Dooku stronger because he trained Qui-Gon, and Yoda stronger than all of them,  because he trained Dooku. Plus Yoda trained Luke, who came 2nd closest to killing Vader. That might indicate Yoda being strongest."
False,0,I was always lead to believe that mace windu was the strongest Jedi and some where I read that he would have be above yoda put turned down leading the council to concentrate on his training. 
False,0,"Luke is not the best when it comes to fighting, force affinity, etc. He is just the coolest and most popular. Obi-Wan during the Clone Wars was better and so was Anakin before he was dismembered. Mace Windu, Ki Adi--Mundi, Aayla Secura, Plo Koon, all of these people could beat Episode 6 Luke in a duel. "
False,1,"I think we all know that Anikan Skywalker was the most powerful when he was not robotic Vader. However he was dismembered by Obi Wan on Mustafar and that took away a considerable amount of his midiclhorians. This means his force potential was severely hindered. Like was the closest in terms of raw power to what Anikan Skywalker possessed. We so even though he was unable to defeat the Emperor, you must also realize that he was only about the level of a Jedi Knight during his second and final bout with Vader . This means that despite his raw power in the force he did not have the knowledge needed to possess a great skill set with it. While Vader and the Emperor did . They had years upon years of training plus much more experience in fighting other force welders. Luke had only ever fought his father. I think that Luke was without a doubt the most powerful, it just took him a very long time to get to that point.

False,1,"@Dotsie not necessarily. There might be a ""minimum height requirement"" to be a stormtrooper, and Luke didn't quite make that requirement."

False,0,"*don't take me seriously on the lousy aim, not the rest of the comment."
False,1,"However, in Episode IV Leia remarks that Luke (disguised as a stormtrooper) is ""a little short for a stormtrooper"" implying that they are all the same height. However, I am fully aware that they are not clones, because clones have twice the growth span of people, indicating that by Episode IV, they would be to old to fight. (but that could justify their lousy aim.)
( Lol don't take me seriously on that.)"
False,1,"In Battlefront 2 it was explained that an insurrection on Kamino shortly after the end of the Clone Wars caused the Empire to destroy all Kaminoan clone factories. So instead of creating more clones, the Empire recruited soldiers from all over the Galaxy as well as utilized clones from a couple other templates. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, Jango Fett clones were a minority within the Stormtrooper corps. "
False,1,"In canon, stormtroopers are not clones. The Emperor phased them out soon after the Clone Wars. Stormtroopers were recruits and draftees. It's the same in the First Order."

False,1,"The old EU, or ""Legends"", had become a cesspool with good writing, bad writing, and outright toxic writing.

The worst part was that some of the good writing referenced things in the bad- or toxic-writing pool.

Rather than trying to sort out the spaghetti mess, which will still cause a lot of protests anyways, Lucasfilm took the easier -- and much cleaner -- decision to just do away with the whole EU.

Start from a clean slate, and build up from that, under the guidance of the Lucasfilm Story Group.

Besides, the way they de-canonized the old EU, by saying that ""some truths might be found in them thar hills"", allows elements from the old EU to be recanonized into the New Integrated Interconnected Canon. And I am 100% content with that.

(In fact, guessing which elements of Legends will next make it into the New Canon, has become a very enjoyable game for me and some of my friends :D)"

False,0,The story line isn't the original one. Disney changed it
False,0,"It's impossible for Jar Jar Binks to be a sith Lord. It is obvious the events on Naboo were to put Darth Sidious (Palpatine) into power. The Rule of Two states that there can only be two sith lords: a Master and an Apprentice. Darth Plagues was the master of Palpatine and was killed after Palpatine was put into power. If Jar Jar was the Master, Count Dooku would have been killed by Jar Jar because it is forbidden for the apprentice to have an apprentice (this is what happens in the Force Unleashed videogame, Darth Vader has an apprentice: Starkiller). I am not exactly sure but I believe the order of the clone army by Master Sifo-Dyas (persuaded by Darth Plagueis and his Jedi friend Dooku) was under the administration of the previous Chancellor. Therefore, I believe the clone army was in production during the events of Naboo. Jar Jar Binks, if he was a Sith Lord would have destroyed his apprentice Palpatine, Dooku, and Darth Vader. Jar Jar Binks is said to have still been in the Galactic Senate, so obviously he is still around, but would have perfect access to slaughter both Sith Lords Sidious and Vader. This does not happen. If Jar Jar is indeed a force user, wouldn't he have attempted to defer young Anakin to the dark side early? Anakin is the Chosen One, prophesized to bring balance to the force. Jar Jar Binks would have had the perfect advantage to convert him at a young age."

"
False,0,"It's such a stupid theory, like seriously, Jar-Jar Binks? It was just a stupid meme saying he's the worst sith lord just because he annoyed people the most, but now people are saying he really is? It's just downright stupid..."
False,0,There would be riots. But maybe they're inevitable.
False,0,Is jar jar going to be in the new movie? IF SO. ... Major Fail 
False,0,"Yes, I agree. They should have lasted at least for a few more seconds. Until only Windu and one other were left. Then they would fight sidious together. Just to show how powerful he was. Then somehow, the other was killed while showing compassion or something. And so on"
False,0,I would've have liked to see kit fisto and the two other jedi last for a little while longer but I think them being killed off so soon added to the pace and emotion of those scenes leading up to order 66 and the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader.
False,0,"I would tend to think it showed the power of Sidious, strength of Windo, and the theory that Sideous had foreseen the scenario to get Anakin to turn, so he ""let""  Mace appear to beat him and scar his face 

Also, this can count on  the  list of cinematics and sub three hour time constraints. . . But remember, before then we never saw The Emperor/Sidious with a light saber, nor knew he even had one, then all the sudden he drops three or Jedi, so when you watched it the first time at the midnight showing . . .wow! 


But an large scale battle between them would have been awesome"
False,0,"No, it showed how powerful Sidious is."
False,0,Sidious OP
False,0,"It was surprise. They didn't expect that to happen, and Sidious shielded his thoughts so well that they couldn't predict his actions. And, as skilled as they are, Sidious is much more so. "
False,0,"Yeah they definetely should have made at least Kit Fisto more powerful, we should have seen him in an epic saber fight, what actually happened was very underwhelming "
False,0,"I know how you feel, like you got cheated out of a more epic battle/struggle . Especially since all 4 jedi were of high caliber , not just windu. A surprise attack doesn't quite cut it, especially with weapons drawn out already."
False,0,They had been warned about him though. 
False,0,"Well would you expect some old man who seemed to be friendly to you all the sudden come flying at you with a saber?

No"
False,0,"I think if there was ever a time for ahsoka in live action, it was in the prequel era.

Clone commandoes, while still extremely skilled, are much more common, with 10,000 in the galaxy. ARC troopers are trained for solo missions, though occasionally work in small groups or in support of non-ARC operations. Commandoes are trained in squads of four, and are rarely separated from their squadmates. "
False,0,I hope that helps. 
False,1,Commandos are much more elite and specialized. Their equipment and armor is much more advanced and they're rarer in the battlefield. Arc's are more common and are just clones with extra training and more elite.

How could you!"
False,0,"For the first comment, Luke does appear in one of the trailers. He is also already considered a Jedi Master come episode 6 and If I recall, in the expanded universe (now legends) they attempt to rebuild the Jedi order and he trains both Han and Leia in the ways of the force and both become jedi along with their kids however Hans son turns to the dark side thus the fall of the whole thing and then Luke goes into exile from his failure.

But again, that's all legend so who know what will come with episode 7."
False,0,And luke is already a jedi
False,0,Leia is force sensitive but i dont think she will become a jedi
False,0,But what about the Jedi Order? They just buzz off and forget about  rebuilding it? I don't think so.

False,0,"It's a sure thing that it's possible. We saw her pose as Asajj Ventress with a similar mask as to that of which the lady inquisitor dons in Rebels. We also know she is very good with droids, and Offee is as well. To the point that Asohka didn't recognize her? Well, I'm not sure. Any more thoughts?"
False,2,Probably not. Ahsoka didn't react when she saw her in the most recent episode. Plus I never saw Barriss as being all-out evil. I don't think she would join the Empire.
False,1,Is not her! In the last episode Ahsoka fought her and she didnt even react as if she knew who she was. =) is a new character.

The Bladewing  (B-Wing) is a very manoeuvrable starfighter  that has been known to singlehandedly destroy entire Victory Class Star Destroyers.
The Skyhopper looks a bit bulky but has proven to be pretty good though I think it's just an atmospherical fighter and that limits it a ton.
Out of the three I'd choose the B-Wing but I already knew of it's existence and It hasn't really convinced me as the best starfighter.

False,0,"1. Commander Thorn
2. Captin Keeli
3. 99
4. Fives
5. Waxer"
False,0,"1. Chewie - killed by a moon. 2. Mara Jade - NO! 3. Hosk Trey'lis - he didn't deserve such death. 4. Meetra Surik - same. 5. Ganner Rhysode - sad, but also very heroic."
False,2,"Chewie all the way, sad but what a bad ass.
Jacen solo
Mara jade
Revans kinda death was horrifying
Darth Vader"
False,0,"1 Fives
2 Gregor ( I know he is not dead but at that moment it was sad)
3 Yoda
4 Waxer
5 Hardcase"
False,0,Agreed 👌🏻😏^
False,1,"1-Darth Sidious
2-Grievous
3-Darth Maul (false death)
4-Boba Fett (false death)
5-I suppose Darth Vader though he turned to the light side so he got what he deserved."
False,0,4 episodes
False,0,Yea youtube CLONE WARS bad batch 3 episode's staying with a distant echo
False,0,He does! They released unfinished story reel episodes that are nonetheless canon and official. You can read all about it here: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/CT-1409
False,0,"Plagueis was known to cheat death. And I agree, we may see more than 10 secs, but he won't have a huge precense until late ep8, maybe not even until 9"
False,0,"No, palpatine killed Plagueis before palpatine was elected supreme chancellor"
False,0,nah he will have more screen time. I really want it to be him as well but it probably won't be 
False,0,Seeing it on the 16th ^^
False,0,Can't wait  I am not only counting the days but the hours as well 
False,0,Let rock...
False,0,"17th here, RIP :p"
False,0,In Australia so get to see it 17th in the biggest IMAX in the world 😳😅
False,1,Someone make time go faster
False,0,Wooooo can't wait!!!!!
False,0,Seeing it 17th its a special!!!!!!😆😆😆
False,0,Going the 18th!!!! 
False,0,"We bought out a whole row, can't wait!!!"
False,0,"Everything post-Rotj was corny garbage that just emulated the stories that came before in the films, apart from the Thrawn Trilogy- which is still corny the post Rotj era had little worth to begin with."
False,0,"--- in like 20 or 30 years, canon will be full of stories again, and will get rebooted as well, because they can't force new fans to read them. Once you start rebooting, you are doomed. R.I.P originality and creativity. All of this for Luke Skywalker's 5 minutes on the screen (or so, take it easy). And yeah, I'm boycotting every canonical SW content (with an exception of Tarkin, but only because it was written by Jim Luceno). Movies included."
False,0,"No point in quitting the EU. It could be simply continued as an alternate universe in form of books and possibly comics (Marvel managed this, but Lucasfilm cannot, of course). The rest would be canon with this Kylo Ren, Rebels and so on. Our money were good to Lucasfilm, but they still happilly stabbed a dagger in our backs. Moreover, by employing people like Chuck Wendig, who publicly offended SW fans, Lucasfilm shows that they really don't care for their fans -  neither the old ones (thanks for the money, EU is dead, buy this new rebooted canon) nor the new ones. By the way ---"
False,0,Pardon me but we are not just a tiny fraction!
False,0,"It wasn't a matter of making the continuity work. It was a matter of creating a story that worked for all audiences. When you think about how much had happened in the EU after Return of the Jedi, there was just too much baggage to make a movie series for everyone. The target audience is the whole world, not just the tiny fraction of Star Wars book readers."
False,0,"I hope Mara Jade appears in the new canon, Thrawn too"
False,0,"Just to clear it out: Only things that are canon now are the movies 1-6, the future trilogy, the newer Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: Rebels. But i agree, the EU had so many cool stories and characters."
False,1,But I agree. I miss the EU :(
False,1,"Actually, hate break it to you, but it's not just post-Endor that's been tossed. It's the entire EU. Everything that's not the movies, The Clone Wars, and all the stuff they've done. "
False,0,I just reread the 2 Han Solo trilogies again for the first time since I was in college 1996ish.  Man those stories are great.  Hope they don't toss those too.  Disney would paint mouse ears on the Mona Lisa if they owned it.
False,0,Or he is Plagueis who wasn't killed but tricked Palpatine into thinking he killed his master but was really a clone of himself who was sleeping.
False,1,"Two possibilities, he's a entirely new character who I think is a humanoid hybrid of Sith and Dark Jedi, hence the New Order. "
False,0,"Plagueis cheats death, there's your solution"
False,0,Sidious killed Plagueis
False,0,It cant be Darth Plagueis for he is dead. In my opinion it must be someone without training corrupted by a sith spirit
False,0,"No. Repulsorlift vehicles need extra modification in order to hover over water. Airspeeders can, though. "
False,0,I have seen it on the main picture of new patch in Star Wars Commander.
False,0,"Repulsorlift technology is made for solid terrain, although it has been known to sometimes travel on water. I think that an AAT wouldn't be able to as vehicles that hover above water have a special type of engineering."
False,0,"I never heard of that, where did you hear that?"
False,0,Rey; mark my words- Finn is a red herring.
False,0,Finn
False,0,Finn is the Jedi 
False,0,no she just ended her affiliation with the jedi order 
False,0,She already kinda did in the Clone Wars series 
False,0,Why?
False,0,And I think the Jedi are in exile.
False,0,And Luke says a line in a trailer and it sounds nothing like Kylo Ren.
False,0,Ben Skywalker is non-canon. He no longer canonically exists.
False,0,"I'm sure there's something mysterious about luke, since it seems he's not been revealed much yet"
False,0,İt is not possible for me. Because rival for kylo or at least master of kylo must be luke or his Son ben skywalker
False,0,"Almost certainly no. There are now several TV spots, promotional photos and other media that show Adam Driver is clearly the one under Kylo's mask, not Mark Hamill. "
False,0,Jedi order all the way 
False,0,One jedi could kill everyone in call of duty 
False,0,"Jedi would crush the call of Duty, they are far more advanced in tech and the fact that they could use the force.  "
False,0,Close call. But Rebels would lose.
False,0,Unsc easily
False,0,Love this discussion.
False,0,"Everyone should bane, I thought he revived the old order of two after finding with artifacts and scrolls?"
False,0,Didn't he create the order of two
False,0,I have heard of it. From master yoda
False,0,Hello
False,0,"Forget canon. In Legends, Windu shatters a Hurrikane native crystal-being. "
False,0,Maybe it's just a rare variant of a power crystal?
False,0,"The short comics ""Stones"" shows Mace shattering part of an alien by accident to get his crystal if I remember correctly. The story was literal in legends, but the origin of Mace's lightsaber crystal in canon hasn't been confirmed.  "
False,0,I dont think so be Cause only two gifted to wield the forces were Yoda and ben Kenobi according to trilogy it has to be cleared that master windu was dead
False,0,He should survive maul got cut in half so he should come back
False,0,"Yeah getting your hand cut off, being electrocuted and being through off the top of a building is pretty bad but he is a Jedi, I think he would be but we really won't know. The great thing about it is if you want to think he survived its your dedication 😉"
False,0,"Even though he wouldn't be dead from that fall, he'd probably have died of old age already"
False,0,"I am sure he is dead, although Disney has a history of reviving dead characters, he seemed super-dead in episode 3"
False,0,"When Maul came back in TCW, Disney didn't own star wars then. Plus that was at the request of Lucas himself. As for Ahsoka, she is Filonis character that only he can touch"
False,0,Darth Maul coming back was before Disney.
False,0,"I have to disagree with you, Hyger3. I don't think Rebels feels like Star Wars at all. I think it feels like utter misery. "
False,1,"Darth Maul came back before Disney acquired Star Wars, and George Lucas and Dave Filoni discussed the possibility of Ahsoka being involved in the Rebel Alliance before the show ended and before Disney acquired Star Wars. That being said, I have enjoyed most of the returns we've seen so far."
False,1,Wasn't the clone wars before Disney?
False,0,If Windu came back he'd have to be a dark sider. Otherwise it would just be Yoda all over again.
False,0,And i hope mace windu comes back
False,0,Fives is my top 3 saddest deaths
False,0,I hope echo comes back
False,0,"Well, whole Rebels are about this. But this is Filoni's problem, too. That guy can hardly create something original. That's why Rebels has SW feel - because it recycles the OT and uses old characters,"
False,0,Dead
False,0,"Did Darth Sidious learn how to bring people back from the dead? If so, did Vader learn this? Could be why the rumours about Hayden Christian returning."
False,0,Only Darth Plagueis can bring people back to life and he's dead
False,0,No he's dead
False,0,I won't :P
False,0,"Wow. How can sex and lekku get mixed up? Actually, don't answer."
False,0,"I can imagine some advantages, but they are 18+ plus :D"
False,0,"And, DarthKrath, at least it's something more interesting to talk about than the usual ""omg I'm so excited Episode VII is almost here"" stuff. "
False,0,"It really depends on the species. Togruta montrals are hollow, and aid in sensing vibrations, a little like echolocation. Nautolan tendrils are extremely sensitive olfactory organs, especially underwater. Twi'lek lekku are basically like having a prehensile tail. Etc"
False,0,"If you take the time to read the page about Lekku and twi'leks it will tell you, there's no need to clog the message board up when you can read it on the wiki you're posting on. "
False,0,Same
False,0,Same 
False,0,Kotor II
False,0,Kotor without a doubt
False,0,But that plot twist 
False,0,"I believe the prequels have a tiny bit of edge on KOTOR, minus Jar Jar and Padmé Amidala's fashion choices; and her politic choices; and marriage choices. 
Every choice let's all face it. "
False,0,Well the unsc soligers have better training but bad armor clones can reproduce by the second so in that factor clones win but dont forget odst and spartans they could kill jedi and unsc bullets are not laser so they cant deflect them in a ground battle unsc air battle star wars
False,0,Ohh thanks 
False,0,The military from the Halo Universe. 
False,0,What is the unsc?
False,0,"Assuming you're talking about the Grand Army of the Republic (The Clones), they're both pretty equal in terms of firepower and skill. 
From what I understand, the UNSC would be smaller than the Grand Army, so there's a factor that the Republic wins out on. 
I think it would really be down to what kind of equipment the Spartans have; if they have armor that can resist a lightsaber, then UNSC. If they don't, the Republic based off of the mere fact that Jedi and Spartans are equal in combat prowess, but Jedi can block bullets; Spartans can't keep from being dismembered. It would be a crazy epic war though. "
False,0,Unsc 
False,0,Is it sensible for Leia to become a Jedi and them both being in exile?
False,0,I Agreement with New republic
False,0,He will be shown very little. But in second Movie he will be in main ı think. They will  ruin Everything luke will clean this mess 
False,0,We're does it say that? 
False,0,Really I didn't know that
False,1,New republic 
False,0,"No I mean like, empire or rebel"
False,0,His actor is listed in the cast so I think so 
False,0,Or scarier......chewwie
False,0,that's probably Han Solo
False,0,"It's possible, but unlikely. John Boyega has been confirmed to play Finn throughout the trilogy, and if the scene of Rey crying is in fact of her crying over Finn, it's more likely that he gets injured in the fight against Kylo Ren than actually killed. "
False,0,That depends on where you live. In my country - nowhere :(
False,0,Barnes & Noble has some
