False,0,Oh. God to hear. He's more fit with his crossbow. I became mad with that guy and woman who took his crossbow and I would kill em if I was there
False,0,"He will get his crossbow, and there's a good chance he will have a date with Lucille...;)"

False,0,Ron isn't gonna make it
False,0,Yes
False,0,Yah I think he was the father figure to the group.
False,0,Maybe? Feel Dale would have been an real good asset even more at that time
False,0,They had to get rid of dale in order to bring in Hershel as ricks moral compass and conscience. I think if dale stayed alive Hershel wouldn't have survived for as long as he did. 
False,0,Those are some pretty tough ones there. 
False,0,"Personally My Favorites

False,0,"Firstly I want to apologise to Walkingdead11 for blaming her (?) for doing hers job. I wasn't supposed to make it sound as I did. Fault is mine and mine alone. Please forgive me.  Secondly, collective voice of fanclub wants to know what happens before February so be it. Need of many overshadows need of few. 
Knowing that Daryl gets his crossbow back males me pretty sure he's safe. "

False,0,To*
False,0,Lmao. Lori was def. too blame!
False,0,He had to go but I still liked him in the end. It was Lori's whore ass that kept pushing him and finally pushed him over the edge. 
False,0,I liked him at first too. But he def. became a loose cannon and he had to go! 
False,0,He had to die 
False,0,Walker because imo it would ruin watching the show for me. 
False,0,The recent scenes with Daryl on his bike is one of the times he have had a couple of hundreds of extras to play the walkers and right now filming the Alexandria area we have a lot of more extras coming in. ☺
False,0,Maximum of walkers you have had on the show at one time?
False,0,Yah every single walk and movement is rehearsed several times. The sounds are then put in after the clip is filmed. No I have never been a walker and I hope I never have to be. Greg (nicotero) was a walker several times. 
False,0,I know about the school it was on a YouTube clip  or did I see it on an amc extra 😁😁🙈🙈I'm not sure😳😳 an orthopedic resident I know told me about the list you have to get on too😱😱have you ever been a walker💁🏽
False,0,"A character, I would be scared of myself as a walker 😂😂"
False,0,There are the same walkers unless they are ones that are seen close up and eating someone etc. 
False,0,A character
False,0,Chericter
False,0,"Hi . Do the same walkers appear in other episodes or is it jus one off?  To answer your q DMariel, definitely a character that doesn't die off next episode. "
False,0,Probably dead.
False,0,Yupppp
False,0,Yaaaaaaaaas I do remember him omg he was driving the truck when Rick and the rest made it out of that department store
False,0,He was with tha group in tha very beginning of tha show he left wit his family on season 1 ep 5 when rick and tha othas went to go see bout tha Cdc
False,0,"Morales got hit upside the head wth a golf club, and some what thrown in a pit with walkers😳😳do I have the right person💁🏽💁🏽let me know👌(the governor killed him)"

False,0,"I kill negan

False,0,"I hope that too!! But I think it's too late for that, Carol is gonna be real mad now 😡😡!! Lol"
False,0,I think when Morgan wakes up he's going to have a change of heart💁🏽💁🏽he's also going to work things out with the group and kill as needed👍🏼😉this is my wishful thinking👍🏼😊😉
False,0,I did like Morgan but not so much anymore. Doesn't he die way before Negan in the comics? I don't think Negan will have anything to do with his death.  
False,0,"Late ...because is thé end negan (juste i can think no is officiel )
Because you lové Morgan  ?!"
False,0,Nope!
False,0,"Nope is imposibleul

False,0,"No Daryl no die XD is good ,  Daryl  is hurt 6x16 but i can't think is dead"
False,0,Srx Norman réduis contra 6x16 ?!!!!
False,0,Killing Glenn right after the whole Nicholas scene would be really dumb storytelling
False,0,Nah he will kill Daryl. Norman Reedus's walking dead contract ends after 6x16
False,0,Glenn because he does in the comics and Daryl is bæ
False,0,Negan rhymes with Vegan 
False,0,Because ?!
False,0,"Negannnn is better 
"
False,0,It must stink badly.
False,0,"Yea but she was a weirdo in the comics, haha. She's a lot different in the show in my opinion. "
False,0,I have an feelin. Remember there was a time where she broke down
False,0,You think that is gonna happen in the show too? I'm not too sure about that. 
False,1,Just survive somehow
False,0,It will be very messed up but it will all come together and will have you at the edge of your seats. Promise. 
False,0,😂😂😂😂 glad to help :) 
False,0,That's good to know 😊👍🏼I feel better now 😀💃🏽💆🏽✊🏽✌🏼️😊😉
False,0,I put up more spoilers there. Check them out! ☺☺☺
False,0,😂😂everything that will happen you won't be prepared for so....😂😂😂 
False,0,Omg😢😢😪😪ok I'm not going to be ready for that whenever it happens😢😢but ok😔😉😊
False,0,And don't be silly ☺ I love having you ask questions. It makes my job all the better. ☺☺☺
False,0,She may grow up somewhat but she won't be like a child. she'll only be a baby. 
False,0,I'm just growing weary of seeing her as a baby. It doesn't matter what age just wanted to know if you guys are going to let us see her grow up period💁🏽💁🏽I know she died as a baby in the comics. I hope I don't get on your nerves with my questions?
False,0,"Judith is going to die and they are trying to keep it as close to her death in the comics. But she is going to die, I can't say when though. "
False,0,That depends on what age you are referring to as grown up.
False,0,Could you tell us who is ricks next love interest after Jessie?
False,0," They better show who their lucilling as if they don't, a lot of the emotional aspects of that scene would be absolutely ruined. I personally think the season wil end with Negan saying ""ta ta"" and he leaves the group with Daryl/Glenn body."
False,0,"Negan isnt supposed to appear till later on of the second part of the season so yes, the chances it is going to be on a cliffhanger are high. There will be minor character deaths though along the way."
False,1,Tell us a Spoiler we don't know or couldn't just read about!! Please!! 
False,0,Could you see anything about perhaps the hilltop? And will we find out who Negan is lucilling or will it be a cliffhanger and we won't find out till season 7?
False,0,Ok good to know 👍🏻
False,0,"Denise will be seen alive again. She will go back to the group. 
"
False,0,*sorry that question was all messed up! But you get what I mean!!
False,0,So will Denise live to patch so she can patch up Carl?
False,0,He kills Dwight and takes it back 😂
False,0,"Maxile why do you think Sasha can't fight? You look a lot like Rick, did you know that?"
False,0,Maggie
False,0,"Nope maggi kill maggi true survive.
But maggi have a childred .
Maggi know fight , and shara  don't know fight whitout

False,0,No offence but Sasha looks as if she could rip Maggie's head off with her bare hands. 
False,1,Maggie
False,0,No weapons.. Sasha
False,0,Morgan peace vs Hershel peace
False,0,Sasha.

False,0,I can't  wait  for  tonight 
False,0,Me too. The season went so fast. 
False,0,I'm a very impatient person!! But this will give me time to read the rest of the comics so I'm caught up. 
False,0,Plus the new issue comes out wednesday!
False,0,I like that they break the show up into two half seasons. The time always goes by fast anyway. I'm an episode behind on badlands so I have plenty to watch.
False,0,That helps 👍🏻 who are the chicks that snuck thru that secret book case door then?

False,0,This video it can be anything.  
False,0,Someone else gave me that theory and it sounds like it could be possible. 
False,0,Hmmmmm
False,0,I'm sticking with that plan. Lol. Where else will they go with Glen? Think Daryl will kill Dwight and take over for him. Maybe!! 
False,0,That's also true.
False,0,I think they are making us believe he's safe so when they do kill him it will be more dramatic!! 
False,0,Yeah sorry to say I believe they will keep Glenn alive being that they kept playing with his death. I think you'll be a knock off the killing him now
False,0,I don't think it's Daryl. Why can't it be Glen??! He's has to live now cause they saved him before? I think there's a chance Glen might still go. 
False,0,You know its really being said that it can be Daryl but I really think it's Abraham
False,0,Ricks
False,0,"Daryl, Abe, & Sasha"
False,0,Walkers

False,0,"COMIC SPOILERS



yeah that would have been awesome if they showed how it happened, and it would have been cool if they showed his son turn. Cause in the comic Morgan ends up keeping him chained in his house. Then when Rick comes back to town Morgan leaves with him to go back to the prison. But before he leaves he tells Rick he is going to kill Dwayne, a gunshot goes off and they leave, then a frame later it shows Dwayne wander out of the house with a shot off chain. He never had the heart to do it, just like his wife in the show."
False,0,I don't like Morgan at all now! 
False,0,"Ooooooo that's what you mean(duh Della) yes it would've been cool and sad at the same time to see his mother eat him, and Morgan loose his mind😳😳🔫🔫and finally kill his wife along with killing his son before He turned🙈🙈"
False,0,"True , would've been cool to see tho"
False,0,When Rick meet up with Morgan that time I think it was in season 3. Morgan told Rick how his son  died so I guess the producers figured that that was enough💁🏽💁🏽💁🏽💁🏽

False,0,"There are a few different ways at looking at it. 

The way I look at it is that the cookie represented Alexandria and the ants surrounding the cookie represented the walkers. The ants walking down the wall represented the saviours heading to Alexandria to take everything they have and take it back to negan. ""Because everything you own now belongs to negan"". 

But. 

Each and every theory mentioned on this discussion feed makes sense. "
False,0,"that could be what it was showing, like the walkers hear him calling his mum and they all attack him i think if it happens like that then his mum will have to leave him to save the whole group, or maybe the ants on the cookie represent the cookie being alexandra and the ants being the walkers overtaking "

False,0,Right?! Lmao 😂 
False,0,I'd probably take my chances with negan too. 
False,0,Thinking I would take my chances as one of Negan's Bitches 😂😂 
False,0,Omg that was bad when he burned the guy face with an iron😱😱😱😱 I think it would be the governor for me👍🏼
False,0,How do you know 😫 I hope they don't do Daryl like that!! I would rather Glenn go! Which I really hate to say!! 
False,0,It's one of the two theories I have mentioned. I'm just unsure which one. 
False,0,Daryl will absolutely get Glenn's comic death without question
False,0,"I never would have thought of that, but your right he might replace Dwight. Especially now he stole his Cross Bow!! He's not happy about that!! "
False,0,And yeah danadro your right. He seemed a lot tougher. That's why I think it's a possibility that daryl will take his place. 
False,0,"Dmariel69 you know when Dwight becomes a ""good guy"" in the comics and becomes the leader of the saviours group. Do you not think there is s chance at all daryl could become the leader? "
False,0,"Thats a tough question!! I'm torn too.. Part of me thinks his Character has been lacking lately and they might kill him off. But they could also pick it back up and have him running shit. I don't like the Dwight they picked for the show. The comic book Character seemed tougher or something, right? "
False,0,Hell no Darryl will not become part of Negan's group👎🏼👎🏼and I think Abraham is going to die like Glenn did in the comic😊✊🏽
False,0,Carol

False,0,"It's a tough one but I would have to go with michonne 

Carol is a hard nut but michonne really knows how to use that samurai sword of hers. "
False,0,"Yeah I understand what you mean. Negan is bigger stronger and more intimidating but he is not an absolute nut case like the governor. 

In all fairness. They are both as bad as each other. "
False,0,Negan
False,0,Sorry but negan makes the governor look about as intimidating as Eugene. 
False,0,"The governor. 

Negan is a horrible person but he also has feeling and an understanding to what's happening and what he's doing for his community and the world. However the governor was a sociopath and he didn't care about what he did to people as long as he was alive and won the fight. "
False,0,You think? Governor was pretty ruthless to remember he had human heads in the tank other than the Walker heads in with throw you into a walker pit look what he did to the people at work very when they went to fight back he killed them all
False,0,Negan💁🏽
False,0,"From everything I've read, his worse than the Governor,  smarter and more ruthless and controlling. Though, people seem to prefer him as the bad guy. "
False,0,Dmariel69 is right. He is the new enemy of the Alexandrians. He is one ruthless guy but I would he say he is as bad as the governor. He is definitely up there though. 
False,0,"Gm he's the new bad guy, and according to the comic book he's worse then the governor. He also kills with no remorse. So there you go he's the new bad guy👌👌"

False,0,Ya its called the last of us very similar to the walking dead there trying to get ellie who been bite but is immune to some scintist so they can cure it and walk across america to get there and joel was payed to take her

False,0,Rickkk
False,0,"Rick. 

All life is precious to Morgan. He wouldn't have the bottle to take Rick down. 

Rick will take anyone on to survive (or to ensure the safety of his family.)"
False,0,Idk💁🏽the skills that Morgan has developed I think Rick is going to have to just give Morgan a head shot from the start🔫🔫🔫🔫
False,0,Stick Morgan and rick's machete hehehe 
False,0,Hand to hand ? Morgan. Wits? Rick.
False,0,The W guy Morgan was hiding knocked Morgan out and took Dr. Beth.  Do you think he's going to protect her or use her as a human shield?
False,0,Who did die cos of him? I know he killed several people earlier and Eastman took a bite for him but no one from main cast died yet cos of him.
False,0,Morgan cost some people their lives.I think morgan and rick will go at it and he will leave morgan laying on the ground.
False,0,"I like that M. has stuck to his principles.  He's trying to redeem for his previous madness. Even if it costs him his life, he'll die honest to himself.  What kind of life is it anyway, when you have to watch your w every step,  see your loved  die. If they won't have nightmares till death they'll have to watch those fuc%=÷ up creatures till then. Hell. "
False,0,Uhmm no comment for this time but the stories begin with mess ends with mess lol 
False,1,Yes I agree Morgan do need to go😡😡I must admit at first I thought Morgan being back with the group was going to be a plus💆🏽💆🏽😉😉but now I just feel as though he just makes a mess of things💁🏽💁🏽I'm no longer team morgan👌👌👎🏼👎🏼
False,0,"Agreed, they are not leaving Alexandria. Morgan is definitely gone soon, his decisions are putting people at risk and his mindset is too different from Ricks. Gotta say though I do love his character."
False,0,Don't be surprised Morgan gets bite
False,0,"Ok I was just thinking of a safe place were the group could go for awhile. Clearly Alexandria looks like it's a lost cause, but ok I'm praying for a safe clearance of alexandria🙏🏽🙏🏽💆🏽💆🏽😊😊"

False,0,😂😂😂😂😂 sorry I might tell you spoilers when it gets closer to the time but for Now its probably best if you just wait. 
False,0,Negan might save Alexandria and demand tribute for it. Negan rhymes with Vegan. 
False,0,Kill Daryl off campaign is on.

False,0,True that! 💪💪

False,0,"Not Sasha.  She's Sexy,  fierce and can kick ass. She should more often kick ass in bikini."
False,0,man that was hard to say
False,0,I'm gonna have to say Sasha
False,0,I love Daryl but I think his Character has played its course. I would hate to see him go but Abraham needs to stay instead!! 
False,0,"I would prefer that Daryl went, but given Abrahams big speech on how he plans to live for a while I think it will be him. I don't think Kirkman will have Dwight kill him since that's how it happened in the comic. Even though that would be awesome, I say Lucille is going to suck him dry."
False,0,"Abraham should survive, He is the only tank left and my favorite. He has become the first character of our group that embraces this world"
False,0,Shouldn't Dwight kill Abraham? 
False,0,Gm I agree Abraham 👍🏼
False,0,My guess is Abraham.

False,0,Happy new year 
False,0,"Shame about Jessie . Do you think  Rick managed to get some sweet, sweaty lovin'? She looks a lot like my friend's missus.  Once, when my friend wasn't around, she said I could have her but I turned her down. Never said anything to my friend though. "
False,0,Thats exactly what I think.. Too much work for every episode. I was thinking Ron was gonna do it right before the wall went down. Maybe the Wolf will shoot him trying to get away? He did have a gun right? i think Denise might go down too. It all depends on Carls Eye if they save her 😂 
False,0,"Yeah they could but I think it would be a big hassle if they had to do the makeup for his eye every shot he is in, plus Deanna is dead and it looks like Denise is walker food so who would shoot him and then who would patch him up. I hope Denise doesn't die but it is looking that way."
False,0,"The hook kicks ass!!! Lol. But you're  right don't think they would do that now. Im still not convinced they will make Carl lose his eye! How are they gonna pull it off? Makeup? They make the Walkers look great so They could make it work, "
False,0,"I don't think they will cut off Ricks hand since they have not done it already, I honestly don't think they should have done it in the comic either. Though it does make him infinitely more badass, especially with his hook attachment since the time jump."
False,0,I wasn't sure if you meant her Hand or his Arm!! Think Ricks Arm is safe on the show? Maybe?!! 
False,0,I've never heard of anyone's arm getting chopped off😳😳😳😳
False,0,You noticed you have not seen Rick's hatchet all season till he broke the door open to get to Carl and Ron. CHOP.
False,0,"Yeah, Jessie's arm is gone for sure."
False,0,Rick's wont! 
False,0,Ok thank God cuz I would have cried if he did
False,0,No he didn't in the last episode 
False,0,"Also with snoop, she was pretty fresh so it's understandable. Maybe that bitch who just killed herself this season."
False,0,With you Snoop man
False,0,Its sofia

False,0,Tara and Rosita👍🏼👍🏼
False,0,They are gone tyreese and noah
False,0,Agreed 
False,0,"It seems like he is running the same course as he did  before Negan arrived in the comic. Rick thinks he is the boss, and gets cocky about how strong he and his people are. That attitude ultimately led to Glenns death, which brought him back down a notch."
False,0,Doesn't change the fact he became an asshole. 
False,0,"Rick is awesome, he has only become the person he needs to. Daryl I would not mind being gone, but they will never kill off rick. I BELIEVE IN RICK GRIMES!"

False,0,Yes I did to😊but it was a must see until the walking dead came on😊
False,0,Its brilliant but I prefer the walking dead obviously☺😂
False,0,By the way.  How stupid is it. Wolf has knife to her throat.  2 guns aimed at him. Not so long ago one of them was scoring headshots with 100% accuracy.  ...and they gave the guns away. One clean shot and there would've been W. on his forehead.  Oh well. 
False,0,I agree with driftwood. She is walker food.
False,0,"My modest opinion : Wolf will die but will save someone in the process.  He won't sacrifice himself,  no no. His death though will open window of opportunity for saving someone.

False,0,"Magna isn't bad news, truth be told they have not done much with her character yet but I feel like Kirkman didn't bring her into the comic for no reason. Issue 149 comes out on the ninth, some crazy shit us going on so maybe she will have more importance after the 150th issue."
False,0,don't even trip
False,0,Thanks Snoop 😊 
False,0,welcome to the app
False,0,Thanks for the welcome Thewalkingdead11 😊😊
False,0,Hahaha.. Hope you meant you weren't trying to offend me?! Lol.  
False,0,Welcome new girl ☺☺☺
False,0,look I'm tryin to offend you but you do kinda look like her
False,0,I mean you kinda look like here
False,0,It's alright 
False,0,Sry I meant better
False,0,Better is what you find better I'm guessing. 
False,0,Well we know two weapons are better but the dude asking what is the better of two lol
False,0,Lol your sounds good even better 
False,0,It's cool😂
False,0,"Wrong post
"
False,0,"Apologies. I should said Hello! at least when I've joined this community.  So.... Hello. I'm MadaFaka2k and I like pancakes.  ;) 
"
False,0,I agree with all but I got to go with Morgan's stick
False,0,I agree both are good💆🏽
False,0,Ok. I get it. So if they are able to survive few more years they might have some king of peaceful existence  as majority of walkers will vanish. Easier said than done though. 
False,0,The longer the walker has been infected the more decomposed it becomes. So the ones who have been walkers for the longest are more decomposed then those of the shortest. 
False,0,"Will they decompose to degree they are no more be able to have motoring skills? How long would that take? 
"
False,0,Yes
False,0,Yes they do 👍🏼some are more decomposed than others.
False,0,That's totally what I was thinking in one of the episodes I saw one that was really decomposed . 
False,0,"Daryl just did to Dwight, did he not? "
False,0,Darell wont give up his cross bow
False,0,"Rather see them taken to Negan and be creative with the RPG they later take back and at least blow a hole in their society, This must be next level warfare. When the Governor attacked ruthless everyone was scared and not yet ready to bite off troaths, Let's see how that goes since I love the confindence of Rick not being impressed by the slaughter party of the termites"
False,0,"I true believe they're going to do some damage🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫and make it back just in time to help save the day at Alexandria. Either lead some walkers away or kill a lot of the walkers, and make a way for Rick or someone to get to the armory. Go Rick and the team💆🏽💆🏽"
False,0,They won't give up without a fight. And they are bloody good fighters.  
False,0,I believe in them
False,0,I think they are going to kill everyone except the leader and send him back to Negan and tell him to go fuck himself. Then go save the day.
False,0,How they gonna help when they are about to give up everything they have? And they are still like 10 or 15 miles away come on man this series is abt to get crazy
False,0,"Ok, my dreams are alive again💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽😂😂😂😂💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽"
False,0,They can still save the day ☺ the gang isnt out of Alexandria yet ☺☺
False,0,They are gonna save her by being a bad ass 
False,1,Ctfu 😂😂😂😂yeah😂😂
False,0,probably with a flare gun to draw them away or use Ron as bate
False,0,"MY POST CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS



5 is the best season of the walking dead for me. 6 is pretty good, and the number of walkers has been astronomical so that's awesome. But 5 is when everyone got back together and went through that epic escape from terminus. It just set the tone for the whole season with the opening scene of everyone lined up on those sinks. And Rick really comes into his role as a wild man in the end of season 4 when he tears up those dudes Daryl was rolling with. I also enjoyed the Beth episodes even though I wasn't a big fan of Beth. Noah comes into the picture, he was awesome while he lasted. It was just awesome."
False,0,I like season 6 too
False,0,"Season 6😉it started with a lot of walkers a lot of excitement👍🏼 After watching fear of the walking dead with their slow start with an abundant amount of walkers. I was ready to continue seeing a lot of walkers anyway, and with the start of the walking dead  season 6 gave me my walker fix💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽 I'm happy😀😀😀😀"

False,0,Tyresse death took like 10 minutes and showed the hallucinations of bob and beth i nearly cried when they had his funeral and when rick put his hat on the cross

False,0,And as I've read from the comic he's vicious 
False,0,Negan was Ina prologue 
False,0,Yes he is the new threat
False,0,"I never heard yet about negan but he is a hot topic now,what is all about negan is he the threat of rick's group?"
False,0,Sup dude 
False,0,Negan I can't wait to see
False,0,That man 7s simply named as Savior 1 in credits and is played by Christopher Berry.
False,0,"It wasn't Negan, that was his saviours, basically his men."
False,0,You will hear negan before you see him with the potty mouth he has on him. That was not negan. He will be introduced the second half of the season. That was however the saviours. Negans group of survivors. 
False,0,"Jeffrey Dean Morgan will always be Denny to me. I told my wife when he was first announced, ""Denny is going to be playing Negan!!!""😱"
False,0,No. That wasn't Negan. That was his group. Well. Some of them anyway. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays Negan.
False,0,I remember Jeffrey dean good  choice he looks a lot like the comic book Negan 👍🏼👍🏼Boy o boy it's going to be hard for the ladies to dislike him😳😳he's a looker😉😉 
False,0,"Ok, well I don't want to see Negan because the guy speaking was super scary😔😔Rick is going to have to go into his crazy again💆🏽💆🏽bite a neck😂😂 ( by any means necessary to protect the group)"

False,0,"That wasn't negan.

False,0,Ok😊I'm gonna look him up right now😉

False,0,PREACH

False,0,"Wolf will die in spectacular manner and save someone with his death.

False,0,Sorry you didn't like it But it will get better 
False,0,Dude chill it'll get better
False,0,I hate Shane!!!!!
False,0,Well Rick would walk into Shane and dale fighting with t dog trying to break it up 😂😂because Shane and dale didn't get along at all 💁🏽
False,0,Rick would go crazy probably and yell at them were lori and probably get another fake call from her
False,0,Ok 
False,0,👌💆🏽😊
False,0,I like the Chicago series ( Chicago pd Chicago med Chicago Fire)
False,0,Great TV show choices and yah I think I'll give American horror story a go ☺☺
False,0,Game of Thrones
False,0,Dexter I  lost interest I don't know why😔😔
False,0,Game of thrones  is one of my favorites( I heard that John snow will be resurrected😳😳💆🏽💆🏽)Mr white breaking bad loved it. Jessie James haven't watch. American horror story is good session 1 and season 4 (with the witches ) are the best to me. Please let me know what you think👌
False,0,"I did also watch dexter, breaking bad and revenge when they were still airing. Those shows were amazing. I think I will give American horror story a try. "
False,0,"I watch game of thrones,  outlander, into the badlands and Jessica Jones ☺☺"
False,0,yo Mac In To The Badlands is my shit
False,0,And modern family
False,0,Season 6 hasn't finished yet 
False,0,"look if I was Carl I would of said ""your dad is an asshole like you, u-bitch-u."""
False,0,Your dad is asshole 
False,0,It's true anyways 😂
False,0,😂😂lol somebody had to do it😳😳😂😂
False,0,I've never been to college I dropped out outta high school when I was a teenager
False,0,Yup I am snoop im first year college so need to pursue 
False,0,you still in college?
False,0,Well dont have time to watch cuz I'm busy at my study
False,0,Lol actually Im not yet watching the last mid ep so I dont know
False,0,"Carl and Ron started fighting, drew all the walkers to Jessie's house were they where😳😳😳😳the house got run over, so they killed 2 walkers but walker blood over them(to distract the walkers) Deanna was already bit and dying so they left her behind in one of Jessie's bedrooms. Deanna opened the door walkers was coming down the hall, and she just started firing her gun 3 head shots straight she did until she was out of bullets. Then she screamed at the walkers, but you know she was getting ate up not much longer after she ran out of bullets."
False,0,"She feel on a saw and she also got bit by a walker. Now Rick, machone, father Gabriel, carl, ron, and Sam was tramped in Jessie's house, and Judith was in the house with them too"
False,0,Deanna died already😳braise yourself girl she's gone yup 
False,0,Deanna it's weird maybe she is going to die I think 
False,0,"And I was blah about Deanna, but she went out like a solder."
False,0,oh yeah
False,0,"Lol it's not the fact that he ""killed the elderly"" are we all forgetting that he was a wife beater and possibly child beater as well "
False,0,Yea
False,0,that's some fucked up shit
False,0,he's dad was an ass hole he killed an elderly
False,0,But your dad was an ASS WHOLE😂😂😂😂😂😘
False,0,Yeah I totally think Sam and Jessie maybe Ron will die in the next episode 
False,0,"""Your dad is asshole""
                 Carl Grimes 2015"
False,0,Hmmmmm
False,0,Carl will lose his eye.......
False,0,"Probably not because the leader of Alexandria in the comics (Douglas) shoots Carl by accident in the comics and Deanna died in last night's episode, so it is unlikely he will get shot, but I do have a strong feeling Sam and possibly Jessie will die."
False,0,Negan is the next governor basically 
False,0,I ain't scared of no negan
False,0,If you think this episode was crazy wait to you see episode 9.......
False,0,"He covers his teams weapons in walker blood so if they cut you, you are infected."
False,0,Pretty much.
False,0,"wait slow down so negan is a combination of the governor, the wolves, shane, and the terminus people? all in one person"
False,1,Negan is the main antagonist in the whole comic book series. He kills Glenn in the comics and is the leader of the saviours. He carry's a bat covered in barbed wire called lucille.
False,1,"He's a better villain than the Governor, can't wait to see him in the show!"
False,1,He is the best enemy the walking dead has ever seen. Can't wait till the next issue!
False,2,well that's a dick move
False,0,I think his savours will kill Abraham 
False,0,I think he's going to kill Abraham 💁🏽I really do
False,0,He may kill someone else
False,0,So glad they're obviously going to get reunited 
False,0,My first thought was call out to her😊😊let her know you're coming for her💆🏽💆🏽
False,0,Yes only sprite ;)
False,0,Only Sprite?
False,0,I love to dink Sprite :)
False,0,Definitely agree. Waking dead and drinking sound awesome.
False,0,"She was quite a key side character to be fair, probably just setting us up for some crazy main character deaths "
False,0,"Me neither, but she went out with a bang🔫🔫🔫🔫💆🏽💆🏽go Deanna 👊🏽👊🏽😉😉"
False,0,Least it wasn't a main character 😂
False,0,I don't really like her but😢
False,0,I post spoilers but i never said that his eye was coming out tonight.......
False,0,My profile picture of Negan is better.
False,0,They went out of the way and gave Rick his machete and Carl his hat because when jesse and Ron die Rick uses his machete and Carl wears his hat. I hope that they aren't screwing with you
False,0,To each is own💁🏽💁🏽💁🏽💁🏽and I don't think that the producers are messing with us😳they're not doing anything different from what other producers do with any other shows. It's really not that deep😳😳😳😳
False,0,I think that he's going to get himself and his mom killed in the next episode
False,0,when I heard that I thought about that family guy episode where stewie is saying mom mom mom mom mommy mommy mommy mommy mama mama mama 
False,0,Sam is beast mom mom
False,0,"Yea he is ""mom mom""  Hello can't you shut up Sam "
False,1,His ass is going to get ate to the bone
False,0,He killed Her? 
False,0,Noooooo
False,0,"I thought the ending was pretty good for mid season. Denise is walker food, I think the wolf will use her to distract the walkers while he gets away. Or maybe Denise will step up to the plate and turn the tables. Just hearing Negan's name was enough of a good ending for me. "
False,0,I saw it on YouTube IM SIKED
False,0,Repeat 12@m
False,0,I did not see it will u find a link for YouTube for me
False,0,"Heck yeah,  we finally get to see Negan "
False,0,True ... True.. Did u see after when tha opening of badlands came on tho
False,0,"Negan didn't cut off Ricks hand, the governor did pretty early in the comic. But get ready to meet a real enemy, Negan makes the governor look like a pussy. Say goodbye to Jessie, Rom, and Sam though. Maybe Ron will live, but given his position in line, I'd say no."
False,0,Negan does make a big change in the group personnel by who he kills off 
False,0,"When I think bout it Abraham might get taken out being that his braveness nd boldness could get him killed standing up to negan. Rick losing an hand hmmm not sure maybe an finger or two. Carl grazed in tha eye prolly, remember like when Daryl got picked off by Andrea when she thought he was an walker"
False,0,"How close to the comic storyline do you think  they are gonna stay?  In the comics Negan kills Glen with Lucille, cuts Rick's hand off and Carl gets shot in the head and loses an eye"
False,0,I wish I could agree wit that.. Kinda worried
False,0,😳😳😳😳😔😔😔😔 they're going to handle it👍🏼👍🏼😉😉I believe in them👍🏼👍🏼💆🏽💆🏽
False,0,Omg😱😱😱😂😂😂😂
False,0,"Yeah I think one of the saviours will kill Abraham, likely to be Dwight"
False,0,Negan will kill daryl
False,0,Really😱😱I didn't know that😳😳
False,0,"Dwight does, not Negan."
False,0,I was wrong they couldn't have fought all those zombies. I just wanted them to be quiet😤😤shhhhhhhh
False,0,Yeah Sam is going to cause jessie and rons death because in the mid season finale he was talking while they were amongst the zombies.😱😱 
False,0,No Negan is here in the comics he killed glenn
False,0,Carl was supposed to lose an eye in this episode 
False,0,True
False,0,"True prolly gonna wind up goin bak to negan, nd he gonna slap him up a bit"
False,0,And they had the same wife
False,0,Look at Dwight tv character in the search
False,0,That is true but he gets the burnt face after we met him and they already introduced him
False,0,"Dwight is supposed to have a burnt face caused by Negan,  and in the comics he has a lot of similar characteristics to the TV Daryl..."
False,0,We already saw Dwight though he was the one that stole daryls bike
False,0,And with this crossbow he'll kill someone. 
False,0,Dwight is the one that stole his bike and crossbow
False,0,Look at Dwight tv character in the search
False,0,"Could be,  I didn't hear his name"
False,0,But Dwight was the one that stole daryls bike they said his name
False,0,I don't think Dwight himself will actually show up.  I think Daryl is his TV counterpart and after the war with Negan and the saviors Daryl will take Dwight's place as leader of the saviors
False,0,No I think it's gonna be different and do u think that Dwight is already part of the group
False,0,Think Negan's group will be call the saviors
False,0,I truly think that the wolf guy likes her👍🏼👍🏼I don't think he's going to hurt her. They may run back inside after seeing all those walkers that's out there😱😱
False,0,"He would most likely keep her alive because she nurse him bak to health she's useful in his eyes, least that's the way I seee it"
False,0,"So did , so did i"
False,0,some guy named negan shows up
False,0,Megan's group did not have any w's on their head
False,0,"Yes it is, I swear Carol knows when nd where nd how to play wit ur head"
False,0,"Morgan should have just stayed psychotic, his all life is precious is gonna end up losing a lot of lives"
False,0,I'm sooooo cursing Morgan out in my head right now😡😡😡😡😡
False,0,Omg 😱😱😱 you guys just don't know I'm freaking out with anticipation to get home and watch😳😳😳😳
False,0,Ooooo shit well there goes Tara's women💁🏽💁🏽and it's good to know they're still there💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽I can't wait to get home. Thank you👌👌👍🏼😘
False,0,"Negan's cohorts finally showed themselves so expect to see him next half season, also they had no W on their foreheads so wonder who the wolves are affiliated with. The main group are sneaking thru the horde trying to get away and Jesse's son is starting to whig out,  Glen and Enid see Maggie stranded by herself on a catwalk along the wall."
False,0,And our fellow colleagues are in trouble... 
False,0,"Carl nd Ron had a little fight , say this much if u watch closely they sold it well when they said Carl's eye could get shot.. But nah. Almost thought.. Nd Deanna died"

False,0,Spencer MIA

False,0,"With Aaron not shown,  he'll probably be the one with Glen and Enid to collect everyone to a safe place"

False,0,I don't ?
False,0,9 o clock
False,0,In the comics Negan is the leader of the saviors. He and his group receive payment from Hilltop and The Kingdom for providing protection from the walkers 
False,0,"Who are the wolves supposed to be?
Ezekiel and the Kingdom? 
Dwight and the Hilltop community?

False,0,Wow this whole time I thought that the governor keep his daughter locked up. Thanks for the clarity 👍🏼😊
False,0,"Negan and Rick are similar in ways. By hey both believe what they are doing for their community is he right thing. Negans way is just a little more abusive than ricks way of leading (and that's saying something). 

The governor on the other hand was a phsycho and sociopath with a severe split personality (eg. Taking his dead brothers identity and keeping his niece locked away as a ""biter"".)

I think that if this was to happen (which it obviously won't, but theoretically speaking) negan and Rick would team up against the loon.   "
False,0,He would be Negan's  bitch😉😉we still would just have to worry about Negan and that's it💁🏽💁🏽
False,0,Ok😊I keep forgetting that carol committed suicide in the book and Sophia is till alive.how sweet you put that (adolescent apocalyptic way) awwwwwww🌹🌻🌼🌺😍👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨💜💛💚💙💝👫
False,0,Yes exactly. That child was Carol's daughter. Obviously Carol has been gone for a long time in the comic and in the show her daughter has been gone for a long time so this wouldn't work. Enid fits the age and bill of the part. Carl is even remotely involved in the comic with Sophie for awhile in an adolescent post apocalyptic way
False,0,In the comic Maggie and Glenn adopt a child😊👌are you saying Enid is going to be their adopted child?
False,0,Agreed
False,0,At'll happen! The show must go on.
False,0,It's ok to each is own😉😉

False,0,"Mid season finale. 

The walkers break into Alexandria. Alexandrians are scared and trying to protect themselves but relying on the skill of ricks survivors to save them. Morgan will die whilst saving Alexandrians. Ricks new lover lover woman will die and her son Sam  because Rick won't save her because Rick looks after his ""family"" and she isn't family. Carl will get his eye shot out by Ron but survive. Ron will die. Abraham daryl sasha Glenn and Enid get back through the broken wall and help dispose of the roaming corpses. Obviously a lot more deaths of Alexandrians but I don't believe any other main characters will die. 

I have a feeling they will introduce a new character at the end called Jesus who will help develop the story of negan in the second half of the series. 


The finale. 

To cut a long story short. Daryl will meet ""Lucille"" and he have a courageous and emotional ending. "
False,0,The Wall falling Will give The Wolf a chance to badly wound Morgan so he'll pay for his stupidity!
False,0,"Ron will shoot Carl, he will survive and its just a graze....I don't think it will be his whole eye though like in the comics.  But the Jessie part will be exactly the same maybe not Sam though, I feel like Sam will be orphaned and carol will be his adoptive mom....not sure of Judith's fate, I think it will throw Rick over the edge for her to die now....Abe, Sasha, and Daryl will meet up with glen and Enid and will either use patty (the fuel truck) or the rockets to save the day.  Glen and Maggie will reunite and adopt Enid as theirs.  The only thing I don't really know how the alpha wolf prisoner things gonna play out??"
False,0,***Of course Carol not sharon!  My bad
False,0,"Sam Will go banans! Sweet mama Sharon messed him up with her ""you must kill or you Will become a monster!"" 
Every Child she gets near loses it or die! "
False,0,"Daryl Sasha Abraham will drive patty that's the truck name. Will brun the walkers
"
False,0,Yeah. And now Maggie will die! Yay! 
False,0,GLENN FOR PRESIDENT! 
False,0,the second coming of Glenn
False,0,Lol yes I enjoy watching that Glenn was alive😊😊😉😉💆🏽💆🏽
False,0,No...she is just in survival mode and for her that is just easiest to do alone
False,0,"No,then why would she help glenn"
False,0,I guess she isn't. She just has suffered a lot. 
False,0,she is 
False,0,No. Just confused but I don't trust her.
False,0,Who knows 🙍🏽but Ron has to go🙅🏽🙅🏽😡😡
False,0,Rather rick with michonne Than rick and Carol! !!!!!!
False,0,"Yeah its from the truck. Rick just wants to be a dad to Ron since he killed his dad. I really don't see what Rick sees in Jessie anyway, other than her being the best looking woman on the show. If you ask me Rick and Carol should get together. They understand each other well."
False,0,"The tower fell because wood was falling off of it, and it collapsed. Probably due to the truck hitting it, and damaging it severely.  "
False,1,To much stress o on it with all the walkers and want in good shape. 
False,0,He has been seen with the eye patch but due to TWDs treatment with Glenn dying I kinda wonder if it has been done just to throw all the comic readers off??  Also love the idea of Ron missing and Carl shooting him in the eye...that would be awesome
False,0,Read someplace that Carl has been seen on set with a bandage over his eye??? 
False,0,"Great prediction, definitely a possibility"

False,0,You know what she's just Afraid 😔😔😔but she better get it together!!!
False,0,Yeah and Maggie is pregnant 😰😦😲 so The show must Milk her pragnantse much more before she Will die! 😬😳
False,0,"Really doubt it will be Maggie, too important in the comics...but ya never know......"
False,0,Maggie won't die right now she is one of the safest characters
False,0,Maybe ricks new lover...
False,0,Probably Deanna because but not like how her counterpart in the comics maybe she gets bitten then dies peacefully
False,0,My money's still on Eugene. 
False,0,I think it's going to be Maggie to because it looked like she wasn't making it up the ladder fast enough so yes Maggie 
False,0,I got my grandson with me
False,1,Enjoy your holiday👌👌from your old head 😉👍🏼😊Dmariel69😊
False,0,"I think it will be daryl. They will not bring Glenn back into the series to kill him off again. It wouldn't make any sense at all. Daryl would be the best choice and the interest between him and carol could see carol having a similar reaction to maggie in the comic series. 

Plus Daryl's character has become Weaker in my opinion in recent episodes and seems to be a piece of eye candy for the lady fans so I don't think he would be a great loss to the programme. 

The character Jesus will be in the programme soon who will take a similar role to daryl anyway (ricks right hand hard man). So it would make sense to kill him off. 

This is just my opinion though. I have no proof what so ever that this will happen. "
False,0,"I honestly don't know...its down to (keeping it true) Glenn, (keeping it extremely powerful) Daryl, (safest choice to not piss off too many fans) Morgan or (going all the way different) Carol.....  Damn it why can't they wait another decade to introduce Negan???"
False,0,None of the main actors won't died
False,0,Eugene
False,0,Daryl or Morgan I'm sorry it is just gotta happen I mean not Glenn they brought him back for a reason so
False,0,Lmaoo someone said Ron 😂im dead
False,0,Or abraham
False,0,"Glenn, in front of maggie"
False,0,It might be Ron or Morgan 
False,0,"Not glen they already did to much to him, Morgan will not allow that we already seen his journey, so either Abraham or Aaron."
False,0,Team glenn ftw!

False,0,Yes the governor 💁🏽💁🏽he had 2 faces 😉😉
False,0,True snoop

False,0,Yes it is short😡😡every time I be like damn that's it😳😳😳😳well the man locked in the bathroom finally became a walker😳😳😳😳it's gonna be a mess on that plane 😔😔😔
False,0,"It's good, isn't everything walking dead good though??  But it's too short each time"
False,0,You should star checking it out it's good I think so anyway 
False,0,I dont
False,0,Possibility she Is out there 😳and she has to realize by now that it's more zombies around than usual so I could Amazon her needing help as well😊
False,0,If merle was still alive then he would be wondering on his own. He was a loose cannon and didn't like taking orders. Plus he had the older brother hold on daryl so there wouldn't be daryl in the tv series. 
False,0,Well Merle would have died before Alexandrian😒because he was such a loose cannon like Shane had become 💁🏽💁🏽Glenn would've killed him for sure🔫🔪Glenn's beef with him was deep👌👌remember that they fault at the prison (I could be wrong but I don't think he would have made it to Alexandria💁🏽)
False,0, He would have left and worked for himself like he said on the talking dead
False,0,he'd probably would of killed every one in Alexandra
False,0,"It wasn't Glenn

False,0,I think it is Glenn but you never know
False,0,I do ☺
False,0,the leader

False,0,I think Carol might meet Lucile. 
False,0,Morgan or Daryl
False,0,Actually I believe that
False,0,Then Carl get his eye shot out 
False,0,Wow 👌
False,0,The walkers will get through the walls and kill Jesse and Sam. Rick won't blink an eye lid at it. 
False,0,It could be Jessie and Sam he kills. That would make it even more personal between him and Rick😉😉just a thought😊
False,0,Maybe 
False,0,That could actually be a good theory... 
False,0,he better not
False,0,Nobody is safe. That's the idea to the series. 
False,0,"Carol.... it is carol 
... last to go .
. For the last season"
False,0,Rick Daryl Carl maggie
False,0,Oh and Judith 
False,0,Rick and Carl and Carol everyone else is free game yes even Daryl 
False,0,Ok that's good to know 😊👍🏼
False,0,They already said that anyone could do in it but they do not want to kill carol because of how much she developed. She is the safest on the show Greg nicotero said it himself 
False,0,no one safe
False,0,"Rick. Carl. Judith. 
I wanna say Carol and Daryl. But I think they could possibly die. This season, maybe not. Later, yes! "
False,0,Ok I do know of one person. Rick everyone else is pretty much open😔sad to write😏😏but yeah💁🏽

False,0,Have a good trip👋🏽👋🏽walking dead new episode tomorrow brah✊🏽✊🏽tell the fam I said hello👐🏼👐🏼and chat with you tomorrow 😊😊😊(I know we're not friends just being nice😊)

False,0,Michonne and Carol they're even love both of them
False,0,😞😀😞😀😞😀😞😀😞😀😞😀😞😀
False,0,Beth was my favorite now since she's dead :-(  now it's Maggie :-) 
False,0,Mischonne .
False,0,Hard to pick between Carol and Michonne. 
False,0,Michonne
False,0,Carol
False,0,"Maggie 
"
False,1,Carol no doubt
False,0,Then he needs to just die 🔪🔫
False,0,What if he's not infected but won't work with anyone that'd be intressting. 
False,0,Bit 
False,0,But
False,0,Lol he dead👌😊✊🏽👍🏼 Morgan better kill his ass🔪🔫I don't have a stick emoji 😳😳😳 yes Jim did start sweating a lot even more during the ride to the cdc😳😳so I can see that theory that what ever happened to him happened just hours before the attack 😉😊
False,0,he dead
False,0,"My Theory:In Here's Not Here, Alpha Wolf said he was hoping to find medicine. His first appearance was in Conquer the last episode of Season 5. If he was bit he would have turned. But he did say he was sweating,in Season 1,Jim was sweating like crazy. So possibly it was a recent wound a few hours(not days or he would have died)so it might have happened before the attack on Alexandria. "
False,0,"Deanna needs to carry around  a foot stole with her😂😂😂😂so she can get the head shots, stabbings right💁🏽(little lady)😊😊she would've been all night with the killing of that walker💁🏽💁🏽😳😳im just saying😒😒"
False,0,"I think he was bit because at the end of episode 4 season 6 Morgan was telling the guy his story right👍🏼then he let the guy speak and the wolf guy showed him a cut, bit, or slash he had on his side💁🏽and the guy said to Morgan I'm already starting to sweet😳😳😳😳so that's why I think he was bit or something😒😒I'm just not sure what the wound is from💁🏽😒"
False,0,"Why do you think he was bit? Morgan popped him in the face with his stick but that's all I can recall. I doubt he is bit, he would already be running a fever and they probably wouldn't be able to do anything with his storyline since even Deanna can take out a single walker."
False,0,I think its those two people who stole Daryl's crossbow and bike
False,0,It's Glenn
False,0,I think it's that guy that DIXON meet in the last episode aka DWIGHT
False,0,Its Glenn
False,0,"It was Glenn. In Thank You,Glenn had a backpack containing a walker talkie,knife,flare gun, and other unidentified items. So while Nicholas was being devoured(after shooting himself)he could have went underneath the dumpster or quickly jumped INSIDE the dumpster. He could have set of a flare diverting the walkers from the dumpster. So it was Glenn cause Paul Monroe(Jesus) was not introduced (yet)"
False,0,It's not Glenn. Norman Reedus already confirmed that it wasn't Glenn. I think it was Jesus aka Paul Monroe from the comics. They already casted him before the season started. 
False,0,It's not Glenn on the walkie talkie but Glenn is alive 
False,0,"Glenn might be alive? YAY I'm sooooooooo happy I hope it is Glenn
"
False,0,it's Rick 
False,0,"I think it's Rick. After they showed the breach in the wall that one episode, I assume the walkers got in. Could be Glenn, but if he is under rhat dumpster I don't think he would want to be drawing any attention to his location."

False,1,they gonna fuck
False,0,The next one
False,0,I like episode 1 season 1 because it shows how it all came together
False,0,I can see that good one👍🏼👍🏼
False,0,I think it may have to be season one episode one. The show immediately captivated me and straight away Rick was a great character. Plus the cliff hanger at the end was incredible when he was stuck in the tank and then Glenn came one the radio to him. That first episode made me want to watch all the rest and I've never looked back. 
False,0,Yeeeeees😉you said it all about the grove👍🏼👍🏼😊😊 it was great work on the directors part(Michael Satrazemis) and all the actors👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽I went threw so many emotions 1rst I was like yes they can stay there find the others and be safe for awhile💆🏽2nd anger like who in the hell is Lilly yelling at she better get that shit right and realize that walkers aren't a new kind of breaded people you can teach and keep as a pet crazy🙈🙈😡😡3rd sadness like owell it wasn't meant pack up and lets keep moving 😳😳😔😔💁🏽💁🏽but yes it was one of the good ones I watched it 2more times🙆🏽🙆🏽I loved it👍🏼😊
False,0,I have another favorite episode 💆🏽season 1 episode 4 vatos😊😉
False,0,"For me its The Grove season 4 episode 14. It captured almost everything the show is. 
Hope. When Tyreese saved by Carol. 
Past catching up. When Carol had to tell Tyreese about Karen. 
Forgiveness. When he forgave her for it. 
Boldness. When Mika was ready to kill the walkers to save them. 
Humanity. She refusing to anything unless its necessary. 
Craziness. Lizzie losing her mind. 
And my favourite themes of the show. Doing what needs to be done. And what the apocolypse does to people. 

And the acting by Mellisa and Chadman was amazing. Even the kids had done an amazing job. "
False,0,Yes I do think he is alive✊🏽
False,0,Does anyone else think that Glenn could be alive
False,0,The grove session 4 episode 14 👍🏼😊😉
False,0,"They probably will just realize that they were stupid to believe she was just a ""den mother"" of this group. "
False,0,Shes class 
False,0,O let me make this clear whom I'm writing this to👌NEGAN👀👀👀👀 I like to be straight forward not beat around the bush and hope that the person know I'm coming at them✌🏼️✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼
False,0,Lol no what is lame is you😳😳💁🏽💁🏽taking what I wrote so personal like it's real life😂😂😂😂😂Writing insults😏😏😏😏please 😏😏NOW READ THIS ITS NOT REAL😳😳😳😳😳and I'm entitled to write my opinion as I see fit👌👌👌👌💁🏽the name calling is childish you must be young😊if you got offended by what I wrote don't read my shit👌👌👌👌👌
False,0,Just so lame to think about daryl and carol hook up. I guess their relationship is like mother-son or sister-brother or just as plain as close friends . I'll be damned if we'll see them fucking. 
False,0,"Lol,  auto correct. Try again. I think it will be Eugene because they need to keep all the strong characters for the upcoming fighting with Negan, etc. "
False,0,I think it who'll be Eugene. They need to keep all the strong cheeseburgers for the upcoming fighing. 
False,0,MAGGIE CAN NEVER DIE
False,0,Maggie is pregnant. I hope they don't kill a pregnant girl. And I believe Darryl will survive till the end
False,0,It has to be Abraham and daryl out of the main characters to die (if Glenn definitely comes back-which rumours are saying he will do as he has been spotted filming). However there is a good chance deanna will die along with a few more back ground faces. 
False,0,"Yes it would be very hurtful if Darryl die😔 I would feel really really really bad for carol because that would be the 3rd big lose for her (Sophia, Mekah,and Darryl) she would just she her feelings down for any other person all together 😔 also can Darryl and Carol get together💏👫before he get killed off the show 💁🏽👌"
False,0,If Daryl dies... I'll just cry my eyes out. Daryl is too much of a fan favourite to be killed. It would be really impactful. 
False,0,No disrespect just joking 😊

"
False,0,Whoo
False,0,Ok😉👍🏼😊
False,0,Yah hopefully that part will be revealed Sunday.
False,0,Glenn did know about the pregnancy already😉👍🏼if you watch episode 1of season 6 again when Rick is asking people to go out with him to lead the walkers away Glenn and Maggie is sitting on the couch Glenn is telling Maggie to stay behind I don't think it was for her to stay and help Deanna like they made it seem😳it was because she's pregnant is the reason why he wanted her to stay behind😉but I can't wait for Sunday to get here so I can see how true this spoiler is👌👌

False,0,"Glenn should already be dead in the show anyway, the way they faked it would have been a great way for him to go out. The only redemption would be a straight from the comic death.

False,0,Glenn a smart guy
False,0,Nooo😔😔😔🙅🏽🙅🏽I'm scared for him to come🙅🏽🙅🏽🙆🏽🙆🏽in the comic he kills Glenn horribly😔😔🙈🙈I'm not ready 🙈🙈
False,0,Shane was my favorite character. 
False,0,Shane was adapting for survival. His conscience was troubled but he did what he had to do to survive. He reacted without hesitation and dealt with it later. His obsession with Lori was his downfall though. His mind was too preoccupied and clouded with jealousy. 
False,1,Shane I do miss because he was a no nonsense type of guy he was that thug I loved it. But Andrea told him in session 2 that his approach was to harsh and his love for Lorre he let consume him💁🏽he no longer wanted to rule with Rick he wanted to rule by himself and o yeah be Rick🙅🏽🙅🏽remember he told Rick that him coming back messed everything up(yeah in his world) I miss him with his fine ass😘😘😘but he had to go because he was no longer a team player bottom line💁🏽💁🏽
False,0,Shane's earlobes tho 😂
False,0,"He was one if the best characters and even though you knew he was going to have to die, it still would have been cool for him to stay a bit longer "
False,0,"He was a good character in the show, a necessary death to turn Rick into the animal he is today. Rick basically IS Sha e now"
False,0,"he killed Otis, he killed Randy, and he tried to kill Rick"
False,0,Yeah but Shane thought Rick was dead. He wouldn't have done that if he knew his best friend was alive.
False,0,well that's true Shane helped carol by kickin ed's ass but he fucked ricks wife
False,0,ctfu?
False,0,Really Ctfu 😂😂😂😂that was funny😂😂that was you dropping like its hot video good concept 😂😂
False,0,Don't believe I'm sorry 
False,0,This may seem corny😳but my husband fond believe you care enough to be on this site talking about the walking dead🙆🏽🙆🏽🙅🏽🙅🏽he thinks I'm the only one that's crazy about the show 😳😳so what can I tell him to let him know that it is uncle snoop😂😂not my uncle I'm probably older than you 💁🏽💁🏽👌if you don't reply it's cool ✌🏼️✌🏼

False,0,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
False,0,TV show. 
False,0,Thanks that's a very good point 👍
False,0,"I'll say the comics are a lot more harder on the characters. The show has toned down a lot. But I believe the show has developed characters lot more than the comics according to me. Though maybe its because I could really see the characters alive. 

Video games are totally different. They don't go so hard on the characters as the show or the comics. "
False,0,"Comics are way better, but the show has really stepped it up since season 4. "
False,0,The comics they're more graphic😳🙈but I soooooo love watching the show love it 😍😍😍😍😍😍
False,0,"Yah the comics are very good
"
False,0,"Comic

Telltale games

False,0,It's only an idea. But never the less. No problem!
False,0,Thanks Deankeary for that💆🏽👍🏼
False,0,💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽hello yaaaaaaaas💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽I can see that hello that's how Glenn is going to be saved yaaaaaas💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽I happy now
False,0,Or will he use it to save Glenn by blowing up the fuel truck?
False,0,Yes snoop he will blow a whole in the wall😁😁I just figured it's so many of them that it wouldn't make it to the wall to damage it at all 💁🏽💁🏽👀the walkers are like 20 deep all around but it is a possibility that it would make it threw no matter how deep the walkers are it is a rocket 💁🏽💁🏽👌👌just wishful thinking on my part😉😉😊😊
False,0,He will use it against the saviours. 
False,0,Oh yah 😂😂😂
False,1,if he does that he gonna blast a hole in the wall
False,0,Oh yah 😂😂
False,0,I don't think it will be any of the original cast. 
False,1,"Why is it so unrealistic if someone doesn't die? Why can't a group of people who can really handle themselves survive? 
I won't mind is someone dies. But why should someone necessarily die. 
And I think Glenn will come back, and they won't kill him now. I guess if they had to, they should have killed him in Thank You. 
They can kill off Maggie. But don't kill Carl and Judith. It would be so interesting to see Judith grow up. If someone has played The Last Of Us on PS3 and PS4 will know what I mean. Seeing the world from her point of view will be entirely different than ours. "
False,0,Those were my thoughts. We think he's dead my heart is broken 💔 they bring him back just to kill him my heart will be broken 💔 stay out my feels TWD!!
False,0,"I agree that it would be stupid to bring him back just to kill him. Perhaps pregnant Maggie instead? Someone in the main group has to die though, it's getting unrealistic."
False,0,You know what that would be stupid for the writers to do that😏but Glenn do get killed by Negan in the comic book.
False,0,I knew he wasn't dead
False,0,https://youtu.be/uH57N5oNYpw
False,0,Oh tnx but there is this video I thought he was dead let me send u de link
False,0,he's ok he just under a dumpster  he may smell but he safe
False,0,💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽yeah😊😊
False,0,He's alive and will be in episode 7
False,0,Lol Abraham better stop starting trouble 😳😳
False,0,Sashraham 
False,1,They have a fuel truck hopefully full of fuel and a rocket launcher 😳😳they're so about to do some damage 👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽to all those walkers outside of Alexandria 💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽watch as I tell you👍🏼👍🏼
False,1,I saw that rocket launcher before he did and my eyes just opened when I saw it
False,1,Clenn😂 Glenn isnt dead hell be back 😂😂
False,0,"At first I thought it was Rick but the more I listened, it doesn't sound like Rick at all. Or anyone we ""know"" actually. "
False,0,"Norman reedus (Daryl) said it was not Glenn but that doesn't meam Glenn is dead it just means he wasn't the one the walkie talkie 
"
False,0,yeah but it's your opinion if you don't believe me
False,0,You the for really real snoop?
False,0,look on my bio
False,0,My honest thoughts were that it should've been Michonne on the fence. Then I actually said I would have rather it been Daryl. And I'm a hardcore Daryl fan. But I just love Glenn so much. 
False,0,I don't want any of them to die kill off the other people 😉😊not the main characters 👌👌
False,1,Like I said if Glenn is already dead then I'm 75% sure that daryl will have the ending Glenn does in the comic book. I think daryl is a good character but I feel like he is just there at times for eye candy for the women fans where as Glenn is a solid character. 
False,0,I don't want either of them to die. True if it wasn't for Glenn then there would be no Rick but Daryl is just such an awesome character that we've seen evolve so much through the series. But if I absolutely had to choose one or the other then it would be Glenn only because ***SPOILERS***he already died in the comic. It was shocking and heartbreaking but Rick and Maggie already buried him and the story goes on. I think the fact that I know it's coming is what will make the loss of Glenn less devastating. 
False,1,I would choose daryl to go. Glenn is a great character and also he is one of the very few characters to have not killed a human. He doesn't deserve to die. Plus if it wasn't for Glenn there would be no Rick. 
False,0,Neither 
False,0,"Neither, sorry, I like them both for different reasons and would be very upset if either was killed off unless it isat their request to do other projects then would really miss the 
character bit would wish them the best. "
False,1,Interesting 😂😂
False,0,"They both are unique in their own way, I wouldn't want to lose either of them but if I had to choose, I'd choose Glenn. "
False,1,I wouldn't want these two characters dead but there are others I wouldn't miss.
False,0,At the scene where daryl and Dwight and the gang were hinting from the saviours you could hear a radio of the saviours talking to each other. That could have been a radio Dwight was carrying because I doubt daryls radio would have picked up there signal because they would have had radio contact with these guys well before this happened. It's only an idea. But just watch that scene again and you will get what I'm saying. 
False,0,I doubt it if it was Dwight cuz daryl had the walkie talkie when they was in the truck 
False,0,I think it's one of two possibilities. It's either Dwight asking help from daryl because he has been captured by Negans men (the saviours)....or its one of the Alexandrian residents asking for help because the herd outside the wall have broken in. 
False,0,"Negan is EXTREMELY against child and domestic abuse, which is shown in the comics very clearly. He wouldn't kill a child."
False,0,"They aren't going to kill a baby on AMC, it just won't happen. Unless it is Maggie and her unborn baby."
False,0,Well it is twd anything can happen 😂😂
False,0,Or will it make Rick stronger? 
False,0,I read that Negan was a mess but that would be just harsh really harsh if that happens 😔😔Rick will loose his mind and never come back😔😔
False,0,It's not an unthinkable idea. If people have read the comic book then they will know the kind of character Negan is so he is more than capable of doing that in the series six finale. However I think the more likely one is either daryl (or if Glenn is alive) meeting the wrong end of Negan's trusty weapon Lucille.  
False,0,I don't think he is going to kill Judith. I only heard that he is killing Glenn who supposedly is under a dumpster.
False,0,Snoop I saw you on ridiculousness😊 the host started talking about lacrosse. Your face was priceless you said what's that I don't know what that is😂😂 that is a whole white sport with a sprinkle of us👌👌although my daughter did play it 😳😳😳😳I found that to be funny (not busing on you at all)😉
False,0,Omg😳😳🙈🙈Sam is Jessie Rick new love son I'm sorry. Yes he does need to get some heart if he can steal chocolate for Carol then he can fight💆🏽💆🏽sorry for the confusion 👍🏼😊
False,0,taught
False,0,I thought my first son (Corde) to be tuff at 8 I taught my second son (Cordell) how to be tuff at 7 and I taught my daughter (Cori) to be tuff at 5
False,0,no Ron's the punk ass Sam just a bitch I taught my kids to be tuff when they was 10
False,0,Yes sam needs to stop being a bitch and blaming is mom for them not being prepared. Rick and the team is there now so no worries👍🏼👍🏼💆🏽💆🏽. He also need to stop stealing food(punk ass) I'm just saying ✊🏽✊🏽
False,0,Glenn isn't dead😁😳I won't believe it😊that was Glenn on the radio 👍🏼👍🏼watch.
False,1,I know he's not dead
False,1,I did see the preview of Nate dogs story coming up on unsung👍🏼I will be watching that episode 👌👌
False,0,People back at Alexandria don't need help think about it😏😏if it's not Glenn it's the people that jacked Darryl 😳😳😳they ran into that big ass heard that was coming their way🙆🏽🙆🏽that's why Darrell told them that they was going to be sorry when the chick apologized 😏just a thought 😳😳
False,0,I think it was Glen
False,0,I think the voice sounded exactly like Glenn's. 
False,0,I want it to be Glenn but it's not but Norman reedus said we will find out
False,0,I know for a fact that it's someone back at Alexandria. I would be willing to bet money on it. I'd rather it be Glenn but I'm positive it's someone back at Alexandria.
False,0,it was rick
False,0,I'm not gonna say anything about the new episode's until you caught up so don't trip lil homie
False,0,"Well I'm sorry for not watching 30 episodes in 5 minutes, common sense, like if I haven't watched the episodes doesn't mean you have to go all out on me. Like chill, I just don't wanna know what happens so please keep it to yourself and if you have something to say that's not polite, then don't say it at all. Thanks "
False,0,I bet the last episode Glenn comes back  because I thought Nickolas fell on top of Glenn I screamed when I saw the walkers tearing the flesh 
False,0,don't trip Steph I won't say anything about the new episodes until you caught up lil homie 
False,0,"Yeah seriously, we're allowed to do that. It's kinda the point. Don't like it? Don't open the app, or go to the website."
False,0,If you don't want spoilers don't even read anything because everyone here talks about new episodes 
False,0,I 
False,0,Nope
False,0,I kinda do and kinda don't 
False,0,Yah you're right . they dont. BECAUSE YOU SKIPPED. ! hahaha
False,0,Seriously? They don't show them using the bathroom but I'm sure they do it. 
False,0,Really😳😳Glenn and Maggie was always doing it 👅👅🙈🙈remember at the prison they were always in that tower getting busy😉😉Glenn was loving her long time 😂😂😂😂
False,0,"they fucked 1 time in season 2,  2
times in season 3 , and I think 1 time in season 4"
False,0,Lads they did it more then once 
False,0,you want to see proof they banged
False,0,They also don't have to show everything. 
False,0,I'm not 9 I just put madi09

False,0,Umm getting attacked by zombies is the whole point of the show 
False,0,I found this one https://youtu.be/mqrxhogu7oA and this one https://youtu.be/UXWFqxKU2qA
False,0,hold up let me see if I can find some rap music
False,0,Rap
False,0,"what you like rap, reggae, hip hopor Cadillac music"
False,0,yeah
False,0,No I didn't think he shot Darryl but I hope they die 😡😡
False,0,I jumped😂 I thought he was done for 
False,0,I got scared when he shot that gun
False,0,Nope at first I thought that too. But Daryl barely flinched. I knew he was just trying to scare him. 
False,0,Isn't Maggie supposed to become a leader?
False,0,He is killing Glenn 
False,0,I thought I read somewhere that he is supposed to first appear in episode 17. Would that be the finale? 
False,0,Maggie is not going to die . Because there is a lot but I could see Dwight and Shelly being apart of the saviors in the show . Negan would not appear on this season finale but it's possible to see him to make appearance in the next season because they just announced who is playing negan 
False,0,"Two Birds, One Stone... Rather then Dwight killing Abraham, they'll have Negan do in Abraham w/Lucille... Glenn's not going anywhere... Neither is Daryl.
Jesus will save Glenn (or at least get him back to Alexandria)... Like how Michonne brought back the Baby Formula to the Prison, similar to her Comic Introduction, but not ""the same""....
"
False,0,They wouldn't kill Maggie of or Daryl cause Daryl is Daryl 
False,0,Yeah I heard that that was supposed to be Dwight. Why do you think Negan's going to kill Maggie or Daryl? I know that there's been rumors about Daryl being killed off because of Norman Reedus' new show but it's only a 6 episode series. And I think they already filmed the whole thing. But why Maggie? I really don't get that one
False,0,That was Dwight and sherry.   According to IMDB.   I wonder if his face will get burnt with an iron later 
False,0,It's good but I want to know what the boy is🙆🏽😁when his eyes turn pitch black 👀👀you better watch out.but if you miss it it'll be on demand that night or the next day👍🏼👌😊

False,0,Me 2 but he ain't dead
False,0,he safe under the dumpster he may smell bad but he safe
False,0,I didn't say he was. I just said Norman confirmed that the voice on the walkie talkie at the end of the episode wasn't Glenn. I'm still holding on to the belief that he's still alive. But with Negan coming I'm very worried as to how long he will stay alive. 
False,0,he ain't dead
False,0,He is alive I'm positive I mean would they really kill off Glenn that's like killing of Daryl 
False,0,they want us to think he dead
False,0,Why is his name taken off the credits if he is still alive??
False,1,Honestly if he is not back in the 2015 episodes he's probably gone.
False,0,he alive 
False,0,please comment on what you guys think of the song

False,0,Negan is way worse then the governor. Negan makes the governor look about as intimidating as Eugene😂😂
False,0,That's negans group. And Negan is not a good guy. We will have ourselves a new governor very soon. Just worse. 
False,0,who are the saviors
False,0,In the comics it's the Saviors. It's about to get real good.

False,1,RUN DARYL RUN DARYL RUN DARYL 
False,0,that was Rick
False,0,Yes at the end of the episode he talks on the walkie talkie
False,0,yes he is
False,0,"I read an interview with kirkman saying that he has another ten years of story lines for Rick alone so yeah the comic should go on forever. However with the tv Series they have had to change storylines with characters because some characters are favoured by fans eg. Daryl and some characters are seen as an annoyance eg. Andrea. In the comics Andrea is a great character but in the tv show she has a pain in the back side and I found it difficult to enjoy watching scenes with her in. 

But at the same time. Like you said. You enjoy them both differently. "
False,0,"Just enjoy them both as something different... Also think of this, eventually the TV Series will end... The Comic Series...? Shall go on forever... It's already in its 12th/13th year... 
"
False,0,Idk tough question
False,0,I disagree. The comic book series has much better story lines. Although I'm not saying I don't enjoy the tv series. It is great.

False,2,"Surely not. 

Glens life comes to an end with negan bludgeoning him to death with his trusty weapon Lucille in the comic series. However if glen has now had his death in the tv series I think that daryl Dixon will have the death that glen received in the comic book series. 

There are rumours as well that Steven yeun has been seen filing more episodes for the walking dead. 

The best thing to do now is just wait and see what twists and turns will come out of series six. "
False,0,No

1) Intestines aren't located in the chest such as the ones being ripped apart, meaning it must have been from Nicholas's stomach on top of glen
2) You can clearly see how much higher the spot glen is being ""eaten"" is from rest of his body
3) He was just screaming, no tears, and wasn't even coughing out blood like everyone else that gets eaten
4) If you look closely at the end of that scene, it appears as glen slid right under the dumpster
5) A extremely familiar situation has happened in the video game in which the dude survived"

False,0,"Honestly this makes a lot more sense then just everybody on the same fourm. Now there is actually a way to keep discussions organized and not just a cluster or people replying to something a day ago with out indicating such. Just make separate posts for separate topics, it's not that hard."

False,0,Def alive!! They ate Nicholas! Whike they ate him he moved under the dumpster and will set off a flare to get the walkers to head away from him.
False,1,Want me to quiz yall on twd 
False,1,"Its already clear that glenn is alive because there is a picture that he is taping a scene with another guy and i think that guy is the one who save him in the walking dead
"
False,0,Dead* lol 
False,0,I don't think hes dread. If you look it's Nicholas shirt and not Glenn so they arent eating Glenn. But there's like 50/50 chance so :'( 
False,0,maybe the gun was jammed
False,0,Glenn still alive 
False,0,i hope not
False,0,No he is not dead
False,0,If you look it's Nicholas shirt and not Glenn's.. But there's a 50/50 chance he is dead. 
False,1,"Apparently but there are thoughts that he escaped under the garbage can and the body being eaten was Nicholas.
 which I believe to be true "
False,0,He should be. I'm on comic 147 and it's just weird. 
False,0,"No. He will just put on another bandaid...Kirkman has said that he regrets cutting off Rick's hand in the comic, plus the cgi would be insane"
False,0,"@DurzoFlint there had to have been blood on the blade that cut rick's hand ( you know, considering it was stuck in a walker). In the comic the saviors  (led by Negan) cover their weapons in walker blood to have their enemies slowly become walkers if they don't fully kill them. It must be something more related to this as opposed to Rick just bleeding out."
False,0,I'm so worried about Ricks hand :'( 
False,0,"The only possible hallucination part would be Nicholas/Glenn situation. Rick will only need to patch up his cut. (No infection from Walker blood) Daryl, Sasha, Abraham finally run into some trouble?"
False,0,old version
False,0,old version
