False,0,"Apologies for the delay in updates comrades, I released the gorillas, and it was glorious. They didn't seem too happy about being locked up in that little room, however they simply could not be tamed. I had to hide in the FEV lab. (Or, you know..I had to go to work, and stuff)"
False,0,Lol

False,0,Sounds about right lol.  I did that twice XD
False,0,This is probably the best post I've seen on here yet. Keep us updated on your troll quest against the Institute haha

False,0,"Count me in! More entries, this is fucking golden"
False,0,I'm not sure about legendary. I know nodded guns are safe though
False,0,Modified guns will have unlimited ammo not sure about legendary
False,0,I was so glad when I found that out.  I was leaving 100 rounds in every npc hoping it would be enough.  Now they get like 15 to be safe lol
False,0,"I have heard varying theories on this.. If you modify a weapon, do they still have unlimited ammo with that weapon? Also, I've heard if you give them a legendary weapon that fires projectiles of any kind, they do not have unlimited ammo... Is this true? Thanks"
False,0,Really? I saw a settler with a assult rifle. I'm guessing that she picked it from a dead raider that attacked a settlement. I'm going to stock them all with assult rifles and shotguns 
False,1,I would guess 5-10 because it fires about abpit much in VATS
False,0,Awesome. Do you know how many bullets the mini gun needs?
False,0,Thanks.  Good tip. Saves more ammo for me to sell lol
False,0,Sweet. Gonna give everyone a plasma rifle

False,0,Lol 
False,1,"Scummy, when you open the trade menu .  You can give settlers clothes and equip them.  Just select the armor, then look at the bottom fir the equip.  Their current clothes do not appear in inventory,  but you can see them after they equip another piece of clothing (such as harness). Apparently they didn't want us to have naked settlers running around every where."
False,1,I had a test and my intelligence wasn't high enough I should've killed a few people first to get the next level up.
False,2,"I changed my dogs name to dogmeat, but now he don't listen, and won't keep the fucking welding goggles on!"

False,0,IM SUFFERING FROM FALLOUTISM BADLY......anyone have some addictol available?
False,0,It's gotten to the point that I dream about it and wake up confused like wasn't I just playing fallout. 
False,0,"Im 14 and im a freshman. I've lost all friends because I moved. None of the younger kids have true problems, and none of the adults understand that adolescent minds feel a lot of pressure for things like chores and school."
False,1,👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻AMEN BRUTHA.  AMEN to that. Im 34 n would love to b in school again but nope i fucked my life up 
False,1,brother you are damn sure not the only one ... I'd settle with no bills lol 
False,3,Lord have mercy. These kids nowadays really don't understand how fucking sweet it is to not have any responsibility besides chores and school. I'd kill to have it that easy again

False,3,Thats something a pedo would say though
False,2,"Sometimes you just gotta place it anywhere then stand farther back, pick it again and it'll click better. 
Another thing I noticed is a piece might not place In a spot on its own but if you place like a floor section out from where you want it then attach another piece it'll click in to place in the original spot that wouldn't work (hope that makes sense cause I'm a little lost and I wrote it)"
False,1,I am fine I know how to cope with it every time it pisses you of just kill the closest person.

False,1,Yes
False,1,Yes
False,0,Im assuming it's bugged. I haven't done anything else or taken any perks that would've boosted headshot accuracy. I just noticed it started happening after I got MacCready's perk
False,0,But it seems like it's bugged. I dunno doe :/
False,0,Oh shit is that why? I was wondering why I had 95% on head shots but like 25% on a torso haha. That explains alot.
False,0,It boosts head shot chance by 25% and it's additive not multiplicative.

False,0,Hey now im nice.  N u know that SSJ3
False,1,It's the Internet. I understand you. I started on Xbox Live when I was a kid. But looking for people to be nice and sympathetic on the Internet isn't a great choice.

False,0,Poopbags if ur level 27+ there is a full set of armor available at an unmarked spot in the city. I think it's like 35 store house or some shit. Tons of walkthroughs on it online tho
False,0,Must be nice i only got a leg n a arm
False,0,X-01 is good times 
False,0,I think I currently have four sets.
False,1,Join the club 
False,0,Yeah
False,0,Bruh you got no idea.
False,0,Amen. 
False,0,"Yeah i got you. He had no right to say any of that. Then afterwards claim he's joking. Especially when he knows you're a father and shit. But he's just a kid. You shouldn't let him get to you.

I say you should just post an apology and take his name off your bio. I don't care if you don't mean it. It'll just help this whole thing go away.

Again. I know this isn't your fault. But I think it would be for the greater good."
False,0,Yea just have him stop talking shit bout me and midnight.  Both have been talking shit bout me since i went off on him for saying he was gonna fuckin kill me.  How would u feel if someone said that to u.  U wouldnt be pissed.  N i said before i know i shoulda left it alone.  Just wish it was back in my day where there was none of this internet bullying   How could someone say ill kill u and ur family over the internet.  Only a child would.  N now u see why i dont add kids.   N u saw thats all i said first 
False,0,"Just calm down. I'm not saying either was right or wrong. They both said kinda stupid things (yes, even you poopbags. You know we're homies but you should've just left it  alone).

Is there anyway I can get you too two settle this? This whole thing isn't good for anybody."
False,0,Wow kid ur in everypost.  U really gotta keep goin huh till i leave.  Fuck u midnight.  N go eat ur moms ass
False,1,"No adult, that has kids especially. Should be speaking to a kid like that, and getting butthurt over an online comment. How many times do I have to explain this to you. I honestly don't believe you have kids, because from the way your acting they would be in horrible shape. Technically speaking from how immature you are. "
False,0,Guess hes just being stupid.  I know i should ignore it but like i said noone (kid) wise should talk to adult like that
False,1,Seriously! 
False,0,I didn't start anything he did
False,0,12 year olds start shit. That's just how it is.
False,0,You have to be joking to say something like that. 😂
False,0,"You sound like a 10 year old, seriously. ""I've been here longer than you, and helped more people."" 😂"
False,2,What is wrong with you people
False,0,"Poopbags, I've been on for days helping people. So, if yiu have no idea of what you're talking about than quit talking. "
False,0,Listen poopbags just lets be friends oh right I forgot u hate kids and u have kids of ur own
False,0,now you sound 12 
False,2,btw im not siding
False,0,Ur the one who keeps posting things about me 
False,0,I can never bring myself to be evil and it was so hard to get the evil trophies in Fallout 3
False,2,Nice! I just walk into settlements and take what I want and build a giant fortress and watch the people come after me in vain. Oddly satisfying.
False,1,I did that on my 2nd except the Prydwen had a malfunction with some c4....
False,2,Yeah I did the same except in my second playthrough I was the biggest jerk. No one liked me. I walk around the Prydwen and get the angriest looks.
False,0,Same
False,0,lmfao to funny 
False,1,Yeah I've scraped a few things in a flurry that I hadn't intended. My fingers are working faster then my brain and that good stuff goes out the window. 😭 oh well 
False,0,It's a pain sometimes for sure. I might add a '*' before the names of the items I want to keep to see if it helps.
False,0,"Been there, maybe mark inventory as ""important or special"" I've scraped multiple items that I didn't want to."
False,0,Sorry word not ford
False,0,Arrow up if it worked
False,1,What u do is click any word and if it said 1-2 or 3 out of for pick the next Ford that's rhymes with the first word or the one that starts with the same first letter try it
False,0,Lockout on terminals don't last long in Fallout 4.
False,0,There is no fun with this. :/
False,0,Sorry I get very sarcastic 
False,0,Wanna fight about it 
False,0,Mystic bugs me.
False,0,Hey it's better then a lot of shit
False,1,No shit 
False,1,Finally someone who understandssssss
False,0,"New Vegas had better game play, weapns, and options for endings. FO3 had better story."
False,0,Everyone....
False,0,Absolutely!
False,2,New vegas killed it.  Coolest armors and weapons out of any fallout were in new vegas
False,0,I love New Vegas bit i shall agree. It's way easier than Fallout 3. But Fallout 3 isn't fun hard. It's annoyingly hard
False,0,They made nv for the people who enjoyed the original fallout games and as a not to the old devs 
False,0,All the way. I think they created nv for all the people that thought 3 was to hard
False,0,Nope
False,0,Meeeeeeeeee 
False,0,When in doubt make sure you have a fatman.
False,0,Yar
False,0,You should have the option to punch them all to death. Then die of starvation once you run out of food and die in the vault. End of story
False,2,When in doubt get in a random Decontamination chamber' that's little colder then usual
False,0,Then you just need a suppressed .50 sniper and a nice roof 😁
False,2,Lol I haven't gotten level 4 on science yet to do it but trust me that's next on the list haha. I wish I could have the stealth boy mod and the jet pack on at the same time
False,1,"I have a suit with a stealth boy and railroad matte black paint lol, I still do it in power armor 🙈"

False,0,I would have my ass beaten
False,0,Thank you fallout
False,0,I feel the same way man
False,0,Yea im not.  Im just saying in general.   Hes just trying to punk me out n NO 12 yr old IS GONNA PUNK A 34 yr old.   I already got screamed at by my 7 yr olds best friends n i screamed right back.   Treat ur elders w respect.  Yea im not old as dirt but if i did that id gotten whooped hardcore
False,1,Yo poopbags don't quit the forum it's all good I know how you feel about the young young kids playing tho
False,0,Exactly.  Im 34 i cant be adding 12 yr olds n thats racist now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.  Whatever
False,2,^^ dear god almighty lol
False,0,I think im done w this forum.  All cause a 12 yr punk like u has gotta talk shit.   Fuck off lil brat
False,0,Lol my dad said if he'd have the choice he'd be a ghoul so he could live forever
False,2,I would do it if it let me live for over 200 years
False,1,Good.
False,0,Burn my face
False,0,I am not going to 
False,0,"That's good too hear... Though, when you think about it... People who have Burnt their face, looks like ghouls"
False,2,You might need mental therapy.
False,2,No.... Not even once.
False,1,Its the limited edition 
False,1,That's where mine is. 
False,1,I got the pipboy in real life
False,2,What evs. I'd probably just have it sitting on shelf anyways
False,0,I'm sorry. 
False,0,I don't have the coin to get one of those
False,1,I bet you have it in your pipboy too. Getting the full experience. 
False,0,That's for weaklings
False,1,I've been on for maybe an hour. It's drained 20% 
False,1,Throw it into saver mode. 
False,0,"Indeed, even though I just spent the last 10 min running away from like 10 named ghouls... Lol"

False,1,Ad Victoriam! 
False,1,Brotherhood!
False,0,The institute is what I decided 
False,0,Idk. Still can't decide. But Im leaning BoS on that particular quest.
False,0,Institute
False,0,"Brotherhood, I found it to be a much better choice 
"
False,1,Brotherhood even though they're asses but give you cool stuff
False,0,What the fuck
False,0,I was just curious how a beautiful lady would go through. Would she look innocent and ball gag u as you turn your back. Or will she layover and expose her belly. I prefer the first choice.
False,0,Awesome and interesting.  Like I said I have been mostly polarizing.  Next play through I will try and be either evil or good 100%.  
False,1,I'm always play good the first time try to do thing the way I would them for real if possible or at least in the best way to benefit the community. But in my second play I do everything opposite I'm a completely evil bitch. I play these games throughly I want to see every possible play through. 
False,0,I'm assuming you are 25 years old?
False,1,Haha I started out the nice guy but for some reason finding it more and more exciting to be bad👿.  To the point I see silhouettes of wooden spoons out of the corner of my eye
False,0,"I am a woman and cannot play as a villain. I'm generally goo,t but sometimes make mean decisions to benefit myself, like stealing or untimidating.  In my 2nd play through of games I try to be evil but just cannot bring myself to make evil decisions and kill good people."
False,0,Not after you leave the Vault

False,0,"Dude, the creation kit isn't out for us too, and the mod tools available do not offer much... But great ideas actually"
False,0,A mod that makes the stuff I place around my settlement actually stay where the fuck I put it. 
False,0,Mods are free on console if you watched the presentation by Bethesda you would know 
False,0,I hope not. That's what makes mods so cool but yea with consoles that's a totally different animal to deal with as far as copyright
False,0,I'm worried Microsoft and Sony won't allow 3rd party content in the mods. I don't know where modding falls on the spectrum of copyright infringement. But maybe if the mods are free that won't be an issue
False,1,Lol thanks Virtuoso
False,1,Everything I want for future mods is what you wrote so good job on that :p
False,0,The only thing they exclude and won't let you use on the console is nudity mods
False,0,Instead of like me where their everywhere but nowhere 
False,0,Unless you want them so you can remember where they are
False,0,Yes but it's kinda pointless. If you have enough beds then they seem like they are happy.
False,0,Ok thank you
False,0,Just like assigning them to crops and guard post 
False,0,Oh ok is it like makeing them do there own job?
False,0,Yes

False,0,That's not sanitary...
False,0,So you just crawl to the bathroom 
False,0,"Yeah, I'm one of the people that hyped about the deliverer. It's a very well made gun. "
False,0,I wear it cuz I put armor over it
False,1,No. The Sole Survivor and the Lone Wanderer characters didn't have the same connection with the vault. In FO3 I felt like it was my home. But now I feel like it's a prison for the Sole Survivor.
False,0,Hi
False,0,I usually do as well. I feel like it'd be much more comfortable than most other clothing in the wastes.
False,1,Oh hey mrbadman
False,2,I put it on for the memories 
False,0,😉
False,0,N hope he understands i dont add anyone under 18. 
False,0,Exactly. 
False,1,"Both of yall are cool, we just acted stupid for a little bit. Lol"

False,0,I didn't make it worse u made it better it finally stopped
False,0,815 ✊✊✊
False,1,No problem ssj. U my homie from 815 yo 
False,1,"No, I'm just wanting to say I'm sorry. If you won't forgive me than that's fine. Btw, don't be like me and interfere with something that's not your business."
False,1,Am I an attention whore?
False,0,See? That's what I was going for! I appreciate it midnight and bags. Just let the fallout continue.
False,0,Yes it is just him but oh well its his opinion i guess
False,0,Its ok midnight i forgive u. 
False,0,Just you
False,1,Is it me or is this guy a big attention whore?
False,0,"No, I'm not leaving. You don't have to either. Sorry, I was in the wrong."
False,0,Ight.  This apps gone.  Thats why i said that.  Just wanted to make sure it was u. 
False,0,I got you. I'm about to have a beer then I'll hop on.
False,0,Ok I'll add u later like on the 18th cuz yeah 
False,0,Mine is BananaButt29
False,0,The only way I would accept fallout as a multiplayer game is if it were local co-op only. Multiplayer online games are filled with assholes who like to Fuck up people's lives in games. I'm over that shit.
False,0,There is an online fallout called fonline reloadided look it up
False,0,"I hear you guys, but the story was so short! I want more destruction lol"
False,0,"I just don't want them to focus on that. Nowadays, there are games without stories. Fallout does its job by countering that!"
False,0,it would suck as much as it would be awesome lol but they would have to find a perfect way to match up ranked players 
False,1,"Co-op would be great, too. I just think it would add a little substance to the game. Maybe not during the story mode, but if it were it's own game mode. Kinda like GTA"
False,2,I'm about co-op. But multiplayer would suck...
False,1,yea ... you know what I'm tlkn 
False,1,"Wiped them out like an outbrea(wipe em out)

False,0,Oh sorry I forgot. I probably should have read the old posts. My bad 
False,0,"As I said, you can buy it from Penny Fitzgerald at Covenant."
False,0,Cool. Where's it at?
False,0,"Well, it has the chance to stagger opponents. It also as fairly higher damage than normal shotguns, I believe. It's a pretty awesome name, too."
False,0,What's so special?
False,0,"It's a unique shotgun. You can buy it from Penny at Covenant, I believe."

False,0,?
False,0,Yeah I'm confused too.
False,0,what
False,0,I read earlier this guy was drunk around noon getting high in the bathroom bitching about his wife.  (Great father material  btw).  Maybe he'll wake up in the morning and realize what a piece of shit he is and stop being butt hurt about comments from a 12 year old on the Internet.  Smdh.

False,0,Dude c'mon act mature about this u don't need me to get kicked off this and xbox
False,2,"I'm 13 btw, and I'm probably 100x more intelligent."
False,1,"Actually, I'm trying to prove how ignorant you are. Then, you're commenting back saying stuff like ""stupid ass bitch gtfo."" So..... you're the one in the wrong."
False,0,N u r no better huh midnight
False,2,"Wow, your definitely the most immature ""dad"" I've ever heard of. You're arguing over a comment online. That's all I need to say. "

False,0,Yea it drives me crazy not being able to move stuff up and down
False,1,On Xbox is there a way to move an item up and down? I can spin them and move them closer and farther away from me but can't figure out up and down
False,0,"Agreed, how sad is it that if a update were to come out including new pieces to build with id actually be excited 😂"
False,1,Yeah it's a real bother to build sometimes and others it's a breeze. I hope they improve it or a good mod comes out
False,0,😂😂😂😂😂 dumbasses
False,0,I love the stupid ass comment guys.  Kill me some more 
False,0,I know right midnightsniper

False,0,Rivet city
False,0,"Too true. Plus, the building possibilities are endless."
False,0,"I do like Spectacle Island quite a bit. It'd be a nice little place to make a home...if you could manage to kill off the mirelurk a, of course"
False,0,"Without all the monsters, rads, and lack of attractive women, I'd say Spectical Island man. That place is awesome  "
False,0,Fair enough. I'd probably want to visit the NCR myself.
False,0,Fucking nowhere?!?... Ok maybe sanctuary hills with out it being nuked

False,0,I agree w jj n the other dude lol.  N jj u got a xbox bro
False,0,I put them in all special perks   4 to each n them got em all maxed out now lol
False,0,"Just spread out evenly, each one will have something you want later down the road "
False,1,That's a great way^ but you also don't want to cut yourself short by playing catch up when you level up. It is quite hard to get everything else up to speed if all your chips are in one pot.
False,0,Put them into Strength and agility. All of the agility perks are great
False,0,"I'm 10 too,"
False,0,Hey Lego batmans pretty cool
False,0,"you literally make no sense, kid. sell fallout and get yourself lego batman or something for christmas, this thread was a waste of both our times."

False,0,Mr juice be nice 🍹
False,0,Connect Tv's
False,3,"Posting this is the opposite of cool, kid. How could possibly dominate anyone on a single player game, sport? Your logic and immaturity are obviously that of a 10 year old, squirt! "
False,0,Please don't treat be different because my age promis me
False,0,Dose my age matter
False,0,Ur dad loves u but u wanna kill him and u referenced me as ur dad n u wanna kill me then.   Now u def aint getting added kid.  
False,0,MATURE NOT EFFING NARURE I HATE THIS AUTOCORRECT
False,0,And I'm 12 everybody stop acting like in 4 cuz my dad loves me and he thinks I'm nature he thinks I'll be very successful in my life but he said my brothers not so much
False,0,This is how I feel right now if Poop bags was my dad I'd kill him in his sleep but in a couple weeks when I get over the sh*t in my life I'll say sorry 
False,0,If anybody wants to know why ive been acting like this is because ny mom divorced my dad then last night they had s*x in the room right next to me then she left again and i hate her I usually don't care what people say about Me but it's a tough time for me right now 
False,0,Sooooorrrrrrryyyyy

False,0,Get a room you two! 
False,0,Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
False,0,Plz already I'm so sooooo sorry
False,0,I got one!   Works pretty good.    Just makes a weird knocking sound once it's locked on then just fire away so long as you pointed in their general direction.  
False,0,Does it have target lock like locks on to someone and hut them no matter what
False,0,Ya I actually found one with the quad attachment on a trap that almost killed me 
False,0,Haha thanks
False,0,Nope but I love your name.
False,0,My favourite place to build is spectacle island walled off the tower area so no one can shut it down.   Super protected the boat gen.   Then built a massive 5 story fortress of raider doom.   
False,0,Use Abernathy Farm. I built a huge mutfruit farm (175 food) and have a large house and walked off the entire area
False,0,Yep
False,2,I build all the time. It's my favorite thing to do on this game.
False,0,Yeah I built a little bit during the story but now that I'm done. I'm starting to build a lot since the settlements are like another game themselves.
False,0,Seems like its the only thing to do to lvl up after beating it from what ive heard
False,0,Im w vs.  i havent done any building just only inside my home plate house.  I wanna beat the game before i build 
False,1,Actually I'm going to live stream on my twitch this build when I start. I'll start around 2:55pm est. My twitch is liqudforce134
False,1,My main base is the castle
False,2,Red rocket is my home base it's pretty sick I keep all my followers there. But no settlers never put up the radio. 
False,0,Mini nuke sparkles and mini gun glitter 
False,1,Any pink power armor needs sparkles and glitter.
False,1,I will destroy everyone with my pink X-01 armour bah ha ha
False,1,Lol love it. The power armor only gets better too 
False,1,And soon you deeeeestroy the entire world at the beginning of the game. ^^
False,0,And skyrim as well
False,0,"I played 3 and New Vegas, I wish I could play the originals. "
False,0,I played fallout 3 halfway but didn't get to finish. Same with oblivion. Bc I didn't really know how to appreciate the gameplay and mechanics but then skyrim came out and I loved it and that's how I feel about 4. This game is so addicting
False,0,You can't get the full experience unless you play at least fallout 3. 
False,0,It indeed is amazing but makes me very angry at times 
False,1,My first Bethesda game
False,1,It's my first and I'm addicted 
False,1,Yes that's me first and I fucking love it. 
False,0,"Wasteland, then Fallout 2."
False,1,"Yo I suggest you try out three. It's pretty great, also I'm sure you'd enjoy seeing what fallout four evolved from"
False,0,Lol
False,0,I not Phillip I donoven
False,1,Hahaha sorry I was just saying. You'll find some friends on here no problem.
False,0,Phillip ????
False,0,Lol
False,0,Im still a friend even tho u are wayyyyy younger than me.   Seems like im the mama murphy of the bunch lik
False,0,I guess
False,1,Ok thank u
False,1,People are pretty nice on here. Some can be dicks though.
False,0,"Or hey, maybe you were just preparing for fallout 4"
False,0,Very sad.  I hated accidentally picking it up
False,0,He sad thing is I collected all this crap in Fallout 3 just because! 
False,1,In combination with the faster AP regen perk it's not to bad.  Just gotta stand still for the most part lol.
False,2,Yes strong back perk is great!  Except it still sucks to be overencumbered in battle
False,2,Strongback perk is a godsend.  Level 3 lets you walk normally while overcumbered (at the cost of AP).  Level 4 lets you fast travel.
False,2,My bed is made of teddy bear And it's comfy as Fuck. I'm completely happy Idk what y'all are complaining about
False,2,How you can make a wall/floor from a couple of pencils and battered clipboards is also a mystery. 
False,2,"Yeah typewriters, fans, and phones are my go to. Plus anything that has wood in it. How you get 2 pieces of wood from a toy car is anyone's guess."
False,0,I never walk by a shiny can or dinner/surgical tray! 😂. I have set up my crops so I can make vegetable starch. Never ending supply of adhesive. 
False,0,dogmeat is annoying af sometimes cuz he blocks doorways Dx
False,0,I want chocolate 
False,0,Lol.  I want a pitbull. Or a baby pittie
False,1,He's cool. I hope there's a mod that comes out that you can turn him into a different dog. I want a weimaraner! Haha.
False,0,Shadowed army helmet
False,0,Use the army helmet
False,1,Red bandana might be cool. But it goes over your face.
False,0,"Agree with the above, just travel between sanctuary and bunker hill."
False,0,Yup
False,0,Ok thanks for the help
False,0,Or sanctuary i find her there almost everytime i go there.  Sometime without her brahmin
False,0,Trashcan Carla? The trader? Idk. I'd try Bunker Hill. Alot of the NPC traders come out of there.
False,0,Melee.
False,0,Thanks guy's!! Yeah I just started playing I'm level 17 
False,0,"As said before, that perk is actually pretty OP. I have over 2,000 rounds for almost every weapon I have besides explosives."
False,1,Yeah just sell the chems and ammo you don't use. It's touch and go at first.
False,0,Put that shit on easy clear out a bunch of places n store all ur junk n shit n turn it back on ur regular setting n ull have tons of ammo
False,0,Lol
False,2,I was having that problem and it's so expensive but with two levels of the ammo finder perk and I have over 200 rounds for ever gun 
False,0,Gun shop in diamond city 
False,0,*it.
False,1,You don't need to be a dick about Bad Man

False,0,No not ipoopbags.   Its ipoopbag.  Lol no S at the end. N no caps
False,0,I tried to add ipoobags but it said you had no gamer points or game history sooooo that's strange lol 
False,0,N awesome join our party ill b back in soon yo 
False,0,Prescription lol.  U mean card lol 
False,0,I got an adapter for my mic and I don't know if It works. I'm going to puck up a live prescription too. Idk if it ran out or not.
False,0,Ok so the spider one is ur account? Lol n thats ok badman i forgive u ur old enough.  Let fear know ill brb i gotta do homework again lol.  My son is home from school n he has some but i will return to party it up very soon not much to do homework wise
False,0,Yeah. Last night I did. I kept spacing out and finally remembered. I added Metal Beard too.
False,0,Ignore me
False,0,Mod on pc is out for that
False,0,"Maybe, look it up"
False,0,"Cait or valentine, they are the most useful."
False,0,Cait all the way
False,0,You should get strong as a conpanyin 
False,0,Cait
False,0,"Hancock, he's just Hancock "
False,0,This is what makes it so hard to pick! They each have really useful things 😅
False,0,I use Nick Valentine because he can hack consoles while i'm busy looting! I also save my points for a different perk. Win win! 😉
False,0,Use*
False,1,"Curie, she is nice and also can make you less stimpaks ;)"
False,0,Alexander station or whatever it's called. The one with the raiders. Has a full set
False,1,You can steal stuff and get away from it if you're [HIDDEN]
False,1,Yeah once you finish his missions its not considered stealing anymore
False,0,thanks dude .. I've seen the one at cabots but don't want to steal until I finish his missions .. I also have the set from ally cats 
False,0,And maybe Combat Zone
False,0,Robco Galleria has a few I believe
False,0,RobCo Galleria
False,0,Cabot house
False,1,Free fall legs I bet 
False,1,What difficulty? That's a tall ass building. I always play survival :p
False,1,"I can jump off that, no power armour, and live"
False,0,It would be nice if it worked on my phone
False,0,I have max dwellers (200)
False,0,Its nice to play every now and again
False,0,It's good for a phone game but I lost interest pretty quick 
False,0,It's a mobile game
False,0,I fuckin hate that shit. They need to fix that 
False,1,"Only happens eveytime i see an enemy. Then i stand up, just as i'm raising the pip boy again i hear all the enemies have now spotted me. SMH"
False,0,I know but damn its so annoying. I don't want to quit sneaking and reveal my position every time I check my inventory.
False,0,You could use your pip boy while you're standing
False,0,Go some ware with a lot of caps get them save and exit restrat the game  and keep doing that in that one place over and over
False,1,Water is the best way. You need a lot of defense though.
False,2,"You have a water purifier you built in sanctuary that feeds purified water into your work bench, it's an unlimited supple just go and sell them."
False,1,Sell your ammo or chems
False,2,Put a couple points into the first perk under luck.  And exchange pre war money for caps rather than store it as junk. 
False,2,Go to Diamond City and sell all the weapons you don't use. Pipes guns for exemple.
False,3,I'm serious 
False,0,Haha
False,3,Sell your companions to slavers 
False,1,"Phantom Pain was alright, its been pretty neglected since Fallout came out tho. I'm not gonna be easily seayed to a franchise when I've been on this franchise for over 8 years, take your petty words elsewhere"
False,1,"Fuck that dude.
Get outta here with that phantom cock bullshit.
Only phantom pain u feel is in ur anus where the cock was last night while u stayed up all night playing it."
False,0,Ok so what's your point
False,1,Why'd have the app then
False,2,I have pain for you.
False,0,There are also 300+ locations. 
False,0,There are more than 15 settlements I have at least 21 so far
False,0,Yes there is go to IGN they have an interactive fallout 4 map with all locations
False,2,Can you post a pic of your map cause there's no reliable map with all locations on the internet yet 
False,1,"I'm not saying discover them, I'm saying build there. "
False,0,I read somewhere there may be close to 30 settlements. Idk how true that is tho
False,1,I have all 15 found lol
False,1,"There are like 15 settlements, make em flourish and let your imagination flow"
False,1,Quest 
False,1,Yeah. Settlements or any questions you can find. Explore places you haven't been. 
False,0,"I was running and shooting one that was following me trying to cripple the legs,and a stupid radstag rammed the suicider 😂😂"
False,2,We already know that it's over when you heard the bip. ^^
False,1,Lol my companion has been through a lot! With my silver shroud outfit on I can hit the dips real quick!
False,2,"Once, I saved when I heard it because it had been a while. I reloaded and tried to get away like 6 times but I did it.

I sacrifice my companion every time."
False,5,GID DMMIT MY LAST SAVE WAS IN... vault 111
False,0,When your crippled or overuncumbered and just gunna walk abit further to get a new location unlocked then bip bip bip.
False,6,I used to be a sole survivor like you then a suicider punched me in the left nipple
False,0,"I actually craft Molotov cocktails whenever I can. 
Plus, I have a full settlement dedicated to farming components needed to make adhesives so I've never really had to worry about it. "
False,0,"Molotov cocktails are a joke, you know that when you first try the mortar grenade. ^^"
False,0,Wa nay

False,0,Love it lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.  Where is this cane u so called talk anout
False,0,Ok 
False,1,"Okay, very good information. ^^"

False,0,Speaking of that deathclaw.    Why does it only attack you?  And not the raiders?   Seems like some serious bull shit to me

YEEEE!! THERE IS STILL HOPE!!! Lol"
False,1,"Yeah, I got one. I think it was Pristine Cake or something like that. Took a damn long time though"
False,0,"Still looks pretty damn good for a 210 year old AIDSberry cake lol 
And I don't even know why I want it, it just kind of caught my eye on day one and I've been trying to get one ever since. Haha "
False,0,No I meant aidsberry

False,0,No u can't only wit BOS
False,0,"Yeah, I think you can get it. I never tried, though. I have enough power armor as is."
False,0,...ok...
False,0,That help
False,0,Idk
False,0,"That companion trick is very handy. Its got me home with all kinds of heaviness.

"
False,0,"Did you know you can command your companions to pick up things for you even if their inventory is full?  It's a glitch, but you might as well use it while it works."
False,0,Scrap guns and ammo on the go. There's a station in most areas so you can get the gun scrap (if youre going to drop it anyway) and its huge weight reduction (all scrapped junk items are 0.1 lbs - so a fat man becomes 0.5 lbs from 20-30lbs
False,1,"Upgrade the strong back perk, you won't regret it.  You can use AP to run while overencumbered and can still fast travel"
False,0,Lol yeah that generator will help you in the long run. Hook it up to a water purifier and you'll make purified water which you can sell and make more money over time.
False,0,"So they killed the old people. Note to self, don't send mom in future"
False,0,No they were long dead lol it was only mr handys hanging around
False,2,They they kill the old people too?
False,0,Rifleman is a great perk to get if you love using a combat rifle and shot gun.    Just wasting foos!   Idiot savant is also another good one.  Even with max intelligence it activates a lot for me.  
False,1,"Scrapper ain't that bad if you're low on screws and fiber optics. The aqua boy is handy when it comes to taking a short cut swimming in water since the perk give you water breathing and radiation resistance. Wasteland Whisperer, Animal Friend, and Intimidation can be good if you need someone more powerful than the other followers. Gun Nut, Weapon Smith, Armor Smith, and Science! are vital perks that you'll need to help you survive by increasing your offensive and defensive abilities by making your weapons and armor better. Medic is in my opinion vital because health is real important when it comes to radiation and fighting enemies since both can kill you than send you back to your last save"
False,5,All of them. Why not.
False,1,"Yah thats the one, that sucks but I do look like a badass boss at ny settlement "
False,0,You mean the X-01 power armor? Naw I tried that it doesn't work
False,0,"Lol yea it saves you a lot of thinking. I've found enough of them before to narrow it down to 3 words which makes it pretty impossible to get locked out hahah 
Can't believe it took you three fallout games to figure that one out 😆"
False,0,"I know now, can't believe I've gone so long doing it the hard way.  Luckily you can always back out and start over before you get locked out. And now you're only locked out for a short period of time anyways."
False,0,Lol we all jumped on it like fat kids on cake!! 
False,0,You have to look for (/<{[ those symbols only the ones facing in that direction and they connect to the ones after it if you click it it will either remove a dud word or reset your tries. There is only one try reset though and the harder the computer the less dud removes there will be  
False,0,Damn u badman 😂😂😂😂😂😂
False,0,Look for things like this <> or this <¥¥^{]\> n u can click om them in one click.  It usually takes duds away or tries reset
False,0,"Look for things like this (@&,&) or <¥|^{*> or {} or [ ]"
False,0,"Thats great to hear, thank you"
False,0,You can gain health back if you use the little water pumps
False,0,Ah damn. I appreciate it!
False,0,The small pumps give water to your settlers but they don't produce purified water in your workshop
False,0,I'm going to have to try it. But the small pumps- not purifiers. 
False,0,Have* lol
False,0,They do depending on what pump u habe
False,0,Yes they do
False,0,If u want to know mine it's BananaButt29
False,0,Uh huh
False,0,Im 14 but I'm mature. 
False,0,Thats mine.  N theres no s at the end bro.  If ur mature enough if ur over 18 u can add me 
False,0,Loma ^

False,0,He would be dead🔫🔪
False,0,Imagine a Fallout 3 Cat Meat. Imagine this face looking to you and you know that it's not possible. ^^
False,0,"I have found cat meat in the game and can't cook it, is there a way to cook it so I don't get rads ?"
False,0,^^^^^^
False,3,Id kill it. Lol. I hate cats lol
False,0,He'd be cat meat?
False,0,R u over 18 n not a whiney bitch?
False,1,What's in it for me
False,1,Why
False,0,I killed them long before the institute came along by the college square
False,0,They are your neighbors 
False,1,I saw them before I beat the game. They just walk around the commonwealth in a pack. And I also believe they're your neighbors
False,1,I thought I heard somewhere that those were the names of your neighbors before the war
False,0,I didn't know glowing ones could do that.  Probably bc I always try to kill them first whenever I see them
False,0,It's truly a pain in the ass. 
False,0,Yes they can. Look up the glowing one for fallout 4. 
False,0,Oh fuck. 
False,0,Glowing ones can revive dead ghouls 
False,0,No the glowing one. I've only seen it done twice. 
False,0,Who revived the ghouls? Macready?
False,0,It'd* smh autocorrect 
False,3,"We don't care 🤗

Although it's be nice to get rid of people like you who just want attention, I highly doubt you'd delete the app. "
False,2,And what if I don't like ? ^^
False,0,"Strait up, that place is dope "
False,0,Sanctuary and the castle are my two favorites. Sunshine tidings has a lot of people and space but hard to defend
False,0,Been trying to find somewhere in city but hangmans alley is the only one I found so far and I love it
False,0,Muahahahaha long live the brotherhood 
False,0,"I use Croup Manor, an easy to protect house with walls that is easy to place to protect. Crazy fawking kids keep causing a ruckus since i'm the BoS's next door neighbor but I still like the Croup Manor"
False,0,"Ah, didn't think of that "
False,0,I fixed the walls. 
False,0,You can just put walls over them. Or use the concrete floors
False,0,"The castle had tons of entrances, remember parts of the walls have been demolished "
False,0,I love the castle ... Only one entrance and many many turrets. 
False,0,Sure
False,0,Nice.  Thanks. Ill hit ya up when i get ob fir a fallout party.  Gotta waut a bit tho till after 430 central time

False,1,"Liquid force

False,1,"SPOILER

False,0,Codsworth in my opinion he suits my play style and supports all my decisions lol and  the others are kinda bitches always getting knocked down. Plus he looks funny in the bowler hat. 
False,1,Lily is an amazing companion 👏🏻😄
False,0,They all have special perks but I like Nick Valentine. He's great for hacking terminals.
False,2,"Guy claims he hates whiny 10 year olds.

Proceeds to whine like a 10 year old bitch on fallout 4 discussions.

Sorry, I couldn't help myself."
False,1,Maybe you're the bitch...
False,2,Than how 'bout you leave her if you fucking hate her so much? You obviously aren't happy about it.
False,0,Rad not rd
False,0,Culd be.  Maybe a rd storm hit us lol

False,0,About 10 or 11... Million
False,0,140ish
False,0,I have about 200. I should use power armor more.
False,0,I keep a steady thirty 
False,0,57
False,0,130 just got lucky 
False,0,Hahaha i Also have like 40 from scavenging.
False,0,Only have 20 left but that's enough to explore in OP armor for dayyys
False,0,35 and I've never bought or stolen any that's pure scaving 
False,0,I have like 46
False,0,The graphics weren't that great to begin with so doubt you would notice a difference. I know I didn't :p still an awesome game though as are all the fallouts. Will admit I expected slightly more with the current gen consoles though. 
False,0,I looked up what they did in the patch after starting up Fallout 4 to be presented with the update. I dont really care if graphics get a slight decrease
False,0,I didn't even know they did that
False,0,"Ok good. Many people get really pissed when games do that, but i never notice it. Its the same thing that happened with The Witcher 3"
False,0,Not at all.
False,0,Suicide 
False,0,One simply does not
False,0,You could be like me an upon reading about this mole rat disease I thought it was what Virgil had. So I refused to give him the antidote and just shot him instead. Was only after I realized it was a completely different quest. Whoops. 
False,0," -_- had I known It was me or him, I'd have used it on me"
False,1,I accidentally killed them all in vault 81 after I did that quest even though I gave the kid his cure
False,0,Only one cure in the game and u have to choose to use it on urself or Austin. I chose Austin and it's only a -10 hit to your HP
False,0,There is a quest at Vault 81  after saving Ashes and coming back later you can get the cure and use it on yourself ir the boy. They all hate you if you use it on yourself 
False,0,Or a chiuauia
False,2,Or a pitbull
False,1,I can't find the brightness option on console wtf?
False,1,Codsworth is referring to lack of lightbulbs me thinks! 😁
False,2,"""'I find this level of darkness completely unnecessary"" - codsworth"
False,0,Hense why we need darker nights! 😢 wonder if any other geniuses got any better ideas! 
False,0,No I don't see anything for brightness in any settings menu
False,0,I'm sorry baby
False,0,"Yeah but then eveything becomes darker, not just the sky, before you post stupid shit man, thimk about it.. simply turning brightness down doesnt fix the problem, you sarcy lil scrub."
False,0,Xxxx
False,0,"The ""settings"" dumbass"
False,0,Lol can you change brightness level after you start game?  If so how?
False,3,"Danse nearly came every time I got into my power armor, worked on it, or even looked at it. "
False,0,Just danse 
False,0,Was it stolen 
False,0,Wait what?
False,0,I didn't read the question. I thought you dismissed Dogmeat after Hancock died and couldn't find him
False,0,Maybe. 
False,1,"I'll never forget the picture of Hancocks legs and upper body laying in the buld head of the Prydwen, next to the pile of ashes of Maxson :b actually, after thinking about it, l set up a nuke mine for Maxson, could it be that Hancock was blown apart because of me 🙊?"
False,2,He's with ghoul Jesus now. 
False,0,I sent him to The Castle and took his coat so he's naked
False,0,"Hancock was the best companion I had, he was the only one that never was in My way, and alway supported me during hard dialogues :b I didnt mind that his perk isnt as handy as others, he was just an awesome partner during my journey 😊"
False,0,"Thx, didnt think about the bell yet, guess I'll give that a try :) "
False,1,Yeah. He never showed up. I still have his stuff its packed away like a memorial basically. 
False,0,Oh ok :( but did you have to send him to a settlement after you chose another companion? 
False,0,Kate. He killed Hancock. 
False,0,If you have your Xbox set up to a constant internet connection it will do it automatically when you turn it on 
False,1,They by default update automatically
False,1,Depends on ur settings but I do know mine updated automatically 
False,0,Lol yeah I let those gorillas out too. They were pretty effective at killing those guys.
False,0,Hell no
False,1,I let the synth gorillas destroy those bitch ass protesters who locked themselves in
False,6,Death you shall have
False,0,Dogmeat can carry 130 which isnt bad! 
False,0,No each companion has a set carry weight. Strong can carry a lot.

False,1,Or you can just sit in a corner and eat some Doritos 
False,1,Yah i know i love the brotherhood 
False,0,Apparently you get good shit tho. You get a jet pack if you do brotherhood

False,0,You take zero fall damage with power armor
False,0,Thats what she said
False,0,Yea kinda sucks all i wanna do is kick her in the teeth so she can go to er n leave me the fuck alone so i can play

False,0,"Danse will love it if you persuade Elder Maxon into letting him live, I forgot why Danse didn't know that hes a synth, it was something about the Institute erasing a synth's memory"
False,0,I just shot him. But he understood the meaning of his death and he took it. 
False,0,"Ik that point, I manage to persuade Elder Maxon to letting him live. He told Danse that hes banned from the Prydemn (or whatever way their ship is spelled) and is not allowed to talk to anyone from the BoS"
False,1,"When I had to kill danse it was heart breaking, but he went out with honor. He with out like a Paladin. "
False,1,They want to exterminate the synths. No exception.

Nowhere near sick of playing and can't wait for new content to come out with my season pass.  Maybe I'll get back to playing Destiny one day but for now......., quite happy to wonder the wastelands for hours a day."

False,1,Why to pay 2000 caps for a tiny apartment when you can build a fucking palace by your own...
False,0,"Maybe I did. I did a mission for the BoS, but just the one. Plus, not sure why Deacon and Tom would turn on me for killing BoS people, since we were there to destroy them. But, made it through. It was on a playthrough I didn't really care about, so it's no huge deal. I was just curious if anyone else had it happen. "
False,0,That didn't happen. I took deacon with me.

False,0,Might be die to a status as quest characters. I don't think they can be killed until the quest allows it. 
False,0,"I walked into Cabot house and immediately got attacked needless to say I demolished them extremely quick .. the glitch ..

I'm in January I think and I am at level 33. But I happened to conveniently travel back to diamond city the morning of Christmas and it was awesome.
False,0,Lol.  I know everyone was talking about it the other day bout how cool diamond city looked for christmas.  I found a random tree tho for christmas n it had the head of a raider on it as a topper lol 
False,0,No probs. I'm curious myself now lol 
False,0,Ahhh ok thats strait thanks for the tip ill do that when i fast travel 
False,0,"lol just keep playing as normal but keep an eye on the date. It goes quicker than you think.
I don't know if the distance on fast travel effects it any way though? "
False,0,Damn thats gonna take forever.  Just loaded my game n it shows it at march
False,0,"Fast travel, sleep and waiting! "
False,1,Thanks I'll give it a try. 
False,0,Try letting them off work or relax at the bar or club they really like that and happiness goes up
False,1,And quick save and kill them all.
False,0,"They like decorations. Put a rug down put up some flags, pictures of cats, nuka cola machines, televisions, chairs...etc. They also enjoy working but make sure you don't over farm. Then they get confused and pissy"

False,0,Who is curie ?
False,0,Couldn't tell ya why though

False,0,"There are now 7 maps i think now, all available free, and the beta had 2 maps! Also there are like 11 different game modes. Get to play as darth vader and luke skywalker, aswell as 4 other heros! The flight superiority is majorly fun not gonna lie. But Fallout4 is good, gotta have my multiplayer fix i guess! "
False,0,"I'm sure the new battlefront is fun, but no campaign and only 2 more maps than the beta?? That's not worth 60 bucks to me. Especially if they want me to shell out another 50 for a dlc that should have been included in the full game. "

False,1,Yepp automatically. Some of them get pretty expensive though but they do come in handy alot. Before the patch I stockpiled shipments of everything and now I'm set for the rest of the game
False,0,So i transfer the shipment to the workshop and i will get it?

False,0,80 damage is pretty bad for level 50+ 
False,1,"Not necessarily, you can mod a pipe rifle to .50 caliber. I've seen some with close to 80 damage or so, that's not bad at all."

False,0,Sanctuary.
False,0,Fallout education just kicked you in the teeth!😠
False,0,"When dealing with large settlements like Castle, Sanctuary, or the Drive In it is not at all convenient to highlight the settler to see where they are assigned.  Many posts, such as guard posts, are spread out, and making everything do that is in the line of sight of the bell is not reasonable.  That is not designing a ""better settlement,"" that is letting one game mechanic dictate where you place everything.  This game is awesome because you can design the settlements however you want.  You may like putting everything together in a central location, I like laying things out in sections and do not mind doing things like putting buildings between jobs.  It seems more reasonable, in a game that thrives on personalization, to put a little caption beneath a person's name or description (settler) that says employed or unemployed than to expect us to design our settlements in limited ways and then still have to ring a bell, wait for all the settlers to arive, and then sort through 20 settlers in build mode looking for a little green highlight and hoping it is not covered by all the other settlers or that I do not lose track of who I checked already.
For the second point, I know you can just dump stuff in the workbench, and that, contrary to most early information, if the bench scraps something for you it automatically stores the leftover parts (I personally verified this a while ago because of contradictory info).  The problem is that when there is a lot of stuff to transfer back to a central supply hub the components weigh a fraction of what the ""junk"" weighs.  Also, it is easier to keep track of what supplies you have after they are scrapped.  Again, this is not game beaking, but how hard would it be to add a ""scrap all junk"" button next to the ""store all junk"" button?
You want me to really whine and complain I could add a #3 and ask why there is no option to cancell supply lines from the supply line view on the map instead of having to catch the person on the supply line after a fast travel, assign them to something else, and then hope that it is the right supply line?  If I started over from scratch it would be easier, but trying to reorganize supply lines after you have over a dozen settlements is a real pain.
Finally, I am not annoyed with thes e things because I do not understand the mechanics or have not played enough.  I am annoyed because these are the things that stand out to me after dozens of hours of play as things that would streamline the game and get rid of needless ""busywork"" simply by adding a couple of menu items.  Also, I am not really bitching, I love this game.  These are just a few things that I think could make it better without sacrificing anything at all in return. :)"
False,0,Yeah definitely need to build better settlements. Put some time into your electric grid. Run wires. Make jobs easy to find and bunched together. It would be nice to be able to assign characters to beds and buildings ect. It would be an awesome improvement to be able to set characters up like fallout Shelter. Make families and kids in the settlements. Build schools and assign teachers. Now I'm ranting. Fallout 
False,0,*Titanic music playing while this guy cries about things he doesn't understand.
False,0,Build your settlement better 
False,1,"As I see what you're saying ^ I'll also have to disagree. Sometimes your settlement is too big to see where they're assigned to. Other structures get in the way. It would be better if they made it where you can get into your workshop, highlight your settler, and it have a caption saying where they work along with the outline of their job's position. "
False,0,"Bro I think you should play the game a bit more before you whine about it. To see what your setters are assigned to 1. Build a bell 2. Ring it 3. Enter workbench mode 4. Look at all your settlers (who have assembled from you ringing the bell) and each of their jobs will be highlighted green when you run your cursor over the settler. And your second point doesn't make sense, all of your junk is saved when you hit ""store junk"" or ""scrap""."
False,1,"It does tell you what a settler is assigned to, when you enter workshop mode and highlight a settler it will highlight what they are assigned to.

But this system could be better "
False,0,no you can scrap apparel at the armor workstation

False,2,I think there's a piece by finishing a experiment in a lab somewhere downtown. It's a side quest. I think it's a torso piece that takes less radiation.

False,1,I got it too but when I put it on my armor it didn't show the health on the pieces quadruple. Did it for you??
False,2,"Maybe one day when I aquire a disposable income, I will purchase said vault suit for my loyal Companion because he deserves the best."
False,2,I know its outrageously badass though.

False,0,He even has the captain hat on still
False,0,Bloody auto correct its veribird
False,0,"you dont need to start a new game lol.

im nearly finished and i've never been to the castle after the quest. just grab all of your materials and relocate? "
False,0,Why would Nick care about the big dig quest?
False,0,"I didn't like my skill tree anyway, the game only takes about a week to beat"
False,0,New game I guess he won't leave the castle :(
False,0,"He is trying to kill me, it's not that I am worried he has shit guns and I have x-01, I am worried about my settlement of 17 people though, the Minutemen won't attack me but the settlers will"
False,1,Its not broken you just get to play without him. Lol
False,2,I am so pissed I had beat the game and nick won't die!
False,2,Thats a tough one man. Could possibly lure him away and put your gun away. Sometimes works. But I'm clutching at straws for you pal. Not a clue.
False,0,None of them 
False,0,Curie... Like hot damn her freaking accent makes me melt
False,1,Cait ❤ 
False,1,Pipers hot! But Caits a freak haha
False,0,C.I.T Ruins buddy not Diamond City
False,1,Yes under diamond city is a gorilla 
False,0,I played through twice with both endings and railroad is my favorite.
False,0,"The Brotherood are hungry from power, we know that. ^^"
False,1,Ok
False,0,"Well you can join minutemen and brotherhood, and minutemen and railroad"
False,0,It be funny if i joined those 3
False,0,"Well there is brotherhood they hate the instute railroad hates them too minutemen dont really care brotherhood trying to save the Commonwealth, railroad just cares about free syths, minutemen want a free and prosperous wastland"
False,0,No just started 'cause i got a suggestion
False,0,What 3 factions should i join
False,0,"Np also join the brotherhood they will give you lots of caps and stuff, by the way are you a old player of the games?"

This is the cat in my picture. Not to overshadow your cat, but this one is prepared "
False,0,Agreed
False,1,He would be a awsome mascot for vault-tec
False,1,"I have a 14 year old wiener dog that would not help in an actual ""fallout"" but I love her lol"
False,0,I don't have a dog don't rub it in :(
False,0,Yup
False,0,I'd love it more if u could have a like one of those giant domestic cats as a companion. I forgot what they're called their badass though and could have some cool sneak attack abilities.
False,1,"I have a cat, so yes, I love my dog. :D"
False,0,If it's the actual bar on the screen that says size then that's just max of stuff u can build 
False,0,"The way they have it is u automatically can have 10 people. And u can have more the higher the charisma so lol 2 charisma is +2 settlers. So the max is 20. U can increase it further with certain cloths. 

A recruitment beacon helps also 

Hope that helps "
False,0,"Also, build stuff people like. I.e. a clinic, bar. But some times it is just slow at some places and fast at others."
False,0,You need to build more and increase population.
False,1,Cool
False,2,"Idk. I'm thinking people will need to mod on PC and bring it over somehow. As Frieza as the mods themselves, I think yhey just want to avoid mods that will ""break"" the game. If the codes of two mods clash, your game could get fucked. As far as applying the mods.... I think they said it'll be very easy. You'll get like a list, I'm guessing at the main menu, and you'll get to pick and chose the ones you want. Then, just start playing."
False,0,"Here you go 

http://imgur.com/6W2KxiX"
False,0,"Sure, give me a bit to find it "
False,0,Post it
False,0,"Is a radiant quest, so it might become repeatable, but only happened to me once so far..."
False,0,That's pretty badass! Hahah so is that a one time thing or will there always be a random chance of it happening? 
False,1,I once killed a settler (just saved and went on a rampage) and found components. So i reloaded to my normal game and shot the guy. I guess there are no investigations in the game bc Preston grabbed my power armor and destroyed me even though he was secretly I synth. I make that synth my bitch now.
False,0,Yes!!!! There's a guest to find the infiltrated synth in your settlements! Apparently you found it before even the quest started! Congrats
False,0,"That's actually pretty awesome. Adds to the game, I think."
False,0,This guy's a faggot ^

False,0,Whi the fuck is digledog
False,0,Lol chill
False,0,Thats kinda what i thought asshole
False,0,Ya it is 
False,0,That's a great game is it your first time? 
False,0,They could do it. Saying they can't is like saying Nintendo can't do sonic which they did lol
False,0,Yes thank you 
False,0,"Open world rpg Knights of the old republic. It's the only right way they could do it. Search your heart, you know it to be true "
False,0,That sounds like a horrible idea since Bethesda never made anything like that before

False,0,Like a kotor 3
False,1,"Nope, just no"
False,0,Lol
False,0,"Haha , i left him behind :)"
False,0,Yeah right in front of maxsons room
False,0,SPOILER man damn
False,0,I found him in the prydwen 
False,1,He goes to the settlement you told him to. If you lose him build a bell and ring it
False,1,I need a Kate shaw here
False,1,At some settlement i thin but i choosen institute and next time put [SPOILER] because some hevnt finshed the game yet
False,0,"Idk,I think you can't. Try the Xbox app if you have win 10"
False,0,"I wanted to just, no questions asked, go on a rampage through the institute, but killing him blocked all exits :("
False,2,"It was out of rage and undisciplined emotion that I took his life after seeing my ""son"" modded out like an abomination."
False,2,Shoot first ask questions later is the moral of this sad story.
False,2,"Same, wanted to see what would happen"
False,0,Didn't hesitate either I hit him with click clack.
False,0,The fuck lol
False,1,So did I. I was like WHAT HAVE I DONE!!!!
False,0,My. God...
False,2,Blame Doctor Li
False,1,Yeah I dumped him he's too judgie for me. Went back and got codsworth we seem to agree on everything 
False,2,I'm melee and i wanted his perk so bad but he's too difficult. He's at my settlement hating every time I get in power armor just to move it around. Can't ever win with this guy
False,2,"If you don't use melee I don't see the point in gaining affinity with strong, unless you are trying to get all the companions perks."
False,2,Yeah he's kind of a tweek. He doesn't like it when you pick locks or wear Power Armor. The best thing he's good for is carrying junk. Which is the only reason I wear power armor.
False,1,"I run with dog meat. He doesn't care what U do, is useful and u can use the lone wonderer perk even having dog meat "
False,0,It's supposed to say *playing 😒 I'm txting lol 
False,0,"Tip:
Never walk into the glowing sea naked and challenge a deathclaw, man learnt that one the hard way"

False,2,Oh I thought getting shot to death was how you levelled up.
False,7,Thanks! I was wondering why I wasn't winning yet from cliff jumping. 
False,1,"Yeah if it's in relation to a gun or character etc it means overpowered. 
If it's in relation to a post or person it will be original poster :) 
Took me a while to figure that one out lol. "
False,0,"Overpowered, or original poster"
False,0,Original gangster lmao
False,0,"I use one which is the laser Gatling gun wit over charged capacitor, charging barrels x+, reflex sight and beam focuser"
False,0,"I use six weapons, just because it's fun. ^^"
False,0,OG?
False,1,Let it rest then prepare to scrap some more
False,0,You sca
False,1,"I had the same plan. 


I then ran out of resources again -_- shit got a bit bigger then the blueprints :p "
False,0,After I do that I like to make a settlement all to myself super fun
False,0,Yep! Get one strong enough to survive on its own then off to the next!
False,0,"I love doing that, and you can do it so much plus when you are done with makeing a super OP settlement you can move to another and do it all over"
False,0,I think they're gonna throw in a new aliens dlc 
False,0,"Well, I bear that the reason there's a harpoon gun file and some many dead mutated sharks/dolphins is because there was suppose to be a underwater side quest. Since they did so much work on it already, I'm guessing there just going to finish that. Besides that, since Bethesda said that they were going to listen to the community, I'm guessing something to do with the capital wasteland. Whether we are going to go back, or someone from the Capital Wasteland is going to come here is anyone's guess. 

With teleportation and memory dens, anything is possible."
False,0,That's a lie
False,0,yep
False,0,Dog meat glitch?!?! Please inform me. I need tons more caps to get what I'm trying to get.
False,0,"Its a solo game.
People are such pu**ies."
False,0,"I just don't understand why anyone cares, it is a single player game.  If you think cheating is bad, don't cheat.  Should they patch the ultimate cheat. . . Easy mode?"
False,0,Before yall hate on me I have a lvl 60 no glitch character and a lvl 65 every glitch possible lol
False,0,"I've been doing a glitch with reactor coolant I make 50 duplicate with dogmeat menu glitch till I'm at 500 and get like 60,000 caps "
False,0,Sounds like she took that waaaaay to personal 
False,0,People should be able to play however they want. Pursuit of happiness man it's different for everyone.  
False,0,The duping glitch is not patched
False,2,Yes because they patched it it doesn't mean it's fixed because if I really wanted to do the glitch I just won't download the patch . But it's a single player game I don't mind being offline on my console . I do not understand why people want you to have the same experience as them. I will alway find a way to be Op and rich in games  no matter what 
False,0,"Oh man, I got too obsorbed in the game. I forgot to check up on this!"
False,0,Hi.

False,0,"Complete Reilly's Rangers quest, then talk to Reilly. You should be able to start an unmarked quest that allows you to get caps in exchange for every location you've discovered, and can come back and get more after you've discovered more"

False,1,For: the pitt 
False,0,LOL DUDE SO FUNY UPBOATED :)))))
False,0,HAHAHAHA have you seen the last video Robbaz made? He killed the cat from vault 81 and managed to give it to the girl as if it was still alive.
False,0,Alright. 
False,0,I'm going to make a laser musket called Nora. Then rename the shotgun Shaun.

False,1,I gave the ring to cait. She don't appreciate it though. So I'm gonna give it to either piper or curie. But to remember I like to use my .50 cal for most of my kills. I like to watch my targets for a little bit and prefer that they're facing my direction when I remove their domes from their shoulders.

False,0,"Bought it, played 4 times in total 1 hour and deleted it. It's pathetic!"

False,0,"Was thinking out getting it but between fallout, destiny and rainbow six I doubt I'll have any time anyway. "
False,0,Well this made up my mind lol
False,0,Wish I never bought it
False,0,"Heard the same thing. Tried watching a few people that were streaming it on twitch, but everyone does the same stuff."
False,0,"It's pretty for a few hours, but it got boring not gonna lie. The game is beautiful in design but there's no campaign and the multiplayer is unbalanced"
False,0,Don't it's terrible
False,0,Wheres it located???
False,1,"That's my go to sword, my favourite one. 😛"
False,0,Oh nice 
False,0,Already had it

False,0,What level were you? Have to be 28+
False,0,They should
False,0,You can drop them and then kinda position them wherever but beware I heard that sometimes settlers will take weapons that are just laying around
False,0,"You can just drop items on the ground then move them in workshop mode. I've done that for all my big heavy guns and random things I want around. 
The problem with it is the don't stay there. I come back after exploring and my guns are all on the floor or half stuck in walls etc. it's really annoying. "

False,0,Ya
False,0,Dupe items with dogmeat until they patch that
False,0,What r some of ur guys thoughts 
False,0,I suggest doing the out cast dlc first you can go there lvl 1 and complete plus get best gun and armor
False,0,The marker is super far north towards the middle of the map. I always make sure I'm high level and go in with as little weight as possible because there is some really awesome stuff in the Pitt.  
False,0,Ok first thing you want to do is get a good level like 15 then head upwards and to the way right
False,0,There only connected to the location its at. Their not all connected 
False,0,They are connected to the workshop in the settlement 
False,0,"That doesn't make any sense really. If the rapture did occur, the believers would leave earth. So the religious wouldn't have to worry about what the earth would turn into.

False,0,"The Courier, considering he must've been a tough son of a bitch for mr house to trust him with delivering the platinum chip. The Lone Wanderer has never even seen combat aside from vault simulations and your occasional radroach infestation. As for the Sole Survivor, though he's a soldier, is not well accustomed to the wasteland. So yeah ... The Courier will probably be the one to walk away from that fight. "
False,0,Courier also got shot in the face and got back up. Without our help. 
False,0,DLCs on NV are harder. 
False,1,"The courier, if you test them from the beginning or end of each game because he starts as the only accustomed to the wasteland and its style of conflict and in the end because of trials and Allies. "
False,1,Yeah but the lone wanderer is The friggin beast from the east. I also thought the Capitol wasteland was more unforgiving than the Nevada waste. Boston is a damn cake walk compared to the dc area.
False,0,"True, but the Survivor has legitimate war experience from before he was sealed in 111"

False,0,I went crazy with it 3 huge 3 story buildings completely walled the area 100%. Beds food water 4 guard posts 8 turrets the whole shabang it's a nice settlement I made. My room being the top of one of the buildings got my stations in it and all. Luckily I don't need to build much else haha so I won't bother. I hung up flags and all haha so don't worry it's ALOT of building before you run out
False,0,"There S a glitch to bypass that.  Drop junk in the ground of your settlement, go into build mode and store the junk. It will free up space"

False,0,"Haha, these are some of the types of moments I love the most in Fallout. Sounds like it was an amazing battle."
False,0,But when you're not strong enough to get in range of a shotgun because the enemy is too tough?
False,0,And a normal shotgun does around 17x more damage per hit vs. a normal minigun. 
False,0,I have a wounding minihun and it rips everytging go sherds in seconds due to the bleeding getting faster per hits given
False,0,Being surrounded by miniguns made them a little more effective
False,0,You could just use like a shotgun and win. Miniguns are weak.
False,0,Yeah I'm a hoarder as well 
False,0,Im w u arthur. Lol. Mine r that way too im thinking bout selling the rest but i like to have inventory lol. To show my friends all the shit i got collected. U can say im a fallout hoarder lol

False,0,Also you can hit multiple enemies at once with just one swing which is really cool
False,0,That's mostly all I use.  Baseball bat with blades. Mine does 109 damage.  I use vats so they can't block hits.
False,0,"Try and get kremvhs tooth, that's my fav melee weapon and will kill most enemies with one hit, and it'll take like 2 or 3 to get a super mutant down. They use no ammo which is great too"
False,0,"Melee is pretty good i would say, a bit over powerd though you can get a weapon that dose 96 dam and your like level 8-10"
False,0,Buy the overseers guardian from vendor in vault 81....one if my favs!!!
False,0,K thx
False,0,The deliverer with the right perks is the only gun you need in the game
False,0,"The deliverer is pretty easy to get, all you need to do is the first railroad mission and it is way more useful than you standard 10mm pistol"
False,0,"Spoiler

False,0,"Ok thanks but I can't build recruitment beacon 
Need more settlers unless I sent them there?"
False,0,"Yes your food and water are linked with supply lines.  So long as you have enough overall water and food then you're fine.  Put big purifiers in settlements with water and put lots of food in farms, it'll all even out and everyone will be happy. Just make sure you have enough defense and beds"
False,0,Can't link water or food supply between settlements. Just scrap resources. 
False,0,I dun know too
False,0,Supply line?
False,0,So how do link water sources with other settlements?
False,0,"Oh but I can't plant the food except water
I can't install a recruitment beacon as well
Yes I did linked it with other farms "
False,1,But your better off linking it with a farm or something
False,0,There's little patches of dirt at the front
False,0,"PS4, it's weird because I'll just be walking along, turn around, and they're floating a hundred feet in the air."
False,0,What system?
False,0,Except for fucking that official Duck dude he's officially a Dbag talking about scrodum all the time.
False,0,Nice. And I know u weren't. Everyone on here is cool for the most part.
False,0,Of*
False,1,"No worries man, I'm not being confrontational. Just didn't understand part if your question "
False,0,You can harvest too. It seems that you get the food either way. And for the most part. But certain foods can be used to craft Corn Starch which is (5-I think) adhesive. 
False,0,I thought their was a deeper system to it my bad.
False,0,OK. Im assuming you have to harvest it and its only purpose is to use to plant more crops?
False,0,"I don't get what you're asking besides how you get your food and the distribution part but, your food will go into your work bench automatically and settlers only starve when your food is at zero"
False,0,And how to distribute the food etc.
False,1,Ok guys

False,0,"I'm not finding my food production in the workshop, do u have to have shops?"
False,0,"Ah, thanks. Like I said, I don't know the exact number. I just make sure my Food is at a higher count than Settlers"
False,0,It's six per settler not twelve
False,0,"No, you can only have 20 settlers at one settlement at a time. Once you assign a settler to a plant, they seem to automatically take on the responsibility of the kind of plant that you assigned them to. So if you planted 12 corn, they should take care of those 12 corn and leave your other kinds of plants alone."
False,0,"Do I have to individually hit every plant with ""command""?"
False,1,I can't spell
False,0,Rumor has it that each settler can be responsible for up to 12 plants

False,1,"They are all Children of Atom, and they are immediately hostile on sight. They use Gamma guns (Radiation guns) so be sure you are stocked up on Rad X and RadAway, bring power armour if you can.

They are easy enough to kill, just bring a good gun and you're sorted. 

(NOTE: There is also a lighthouse just ahead of the crater. That also has Children Of Atom occupants, and a Glowing One in the lighthouse tower.)

False,0,Kyle what are modkits 
False,0,"@The wanderer
A ton of games and movie series's do that. It's so that they can put out more content that isn't better enough, compared to the newest game, to be considered one of the ""main series."" New Vegas for example, it's mostly the same as 3 but with a bit of crafting and some mods you can buy for weapons. That's about it. "
False,0,Tactics and brotherhood of steel are the same
False,0,Fallout 4 is technically fallout 7 with fallout 1 2 3 and new Vegas tactics and brotherhood of steel just saying 
False,1,He's got a point though. Mod kits will be awesome too. Probably enough extras from DLC and mods to make a whole new game anyways

False,2,Doc hasn't even can out yet
False,0,"New Vegas had better gameplay, Fallout 3 had better story"
False,0,Fallout 3 if you like more urban setting/ story is mostly focused on you. Fallout new Vegas if you like that cowboy/western feel and want to get into the politics of reshaping the Mohave. Both are great in my opinion.
False,0,Awful opinions HOOOOOOOO

False,0,Go to her wikia page. It has her list of looks and dislikes
False,0,Oh ok i just stole from the major and she didnt like that:(
False,0,I just kept her as a companion for a bit. She likes it when you're nice to people. She eventually just asked if she could talk to me and then I agreed to help her find a doctor that could help her.

Behemoth runs past and attacks death claw (actually saving my sorry ass). I repaid the help in shot gun blasts "
False,0,First time in Lexington (like lvl 6) and ~20 ghouls come out of nowhere and run me down. It was like out of 28 days later.  Did not expect that and ran like a little girl. Cheap play style note - they can't get you on top of a car. They swarm for a minute then run a way and hide. Kinda cheap/lame but better than dying.

False,0,"You can kill Mama Murphy?! What sick bastard made that possible,her dialogue is priceless"
False,0,"My settlers don't die unless I shoot them. For some reason they're set to essential when enemies attack, so when they lose their health they just sit there for awhile. But as soon as my bullet hits them they die. It does the same for Caravan Guards and travelling Merchants. "
False,0,nah I don't think she carries anything
False,0,Will I get anything out of mama Murphy before I decide to blow the crusty old meth slags brains out ?

False,0,I really like the T-45 but I prefer the T-60 because it is symetric.
False,0,"I'm using the T-60 the most right now, actually. It's probably my second favorite now."

False,0,My dick
False,0,Damn..I missed out on a lot then since I didn't do many missions for any of ghe factions except for minute men..but surely that can't mean I miss out on over 40 locations but at the same time I have literally walked every edge and everywhere in between and I'm not seeing anywhere I don't have...strange..Thanks for all the input guys much more useful than trawling the internet looking for answers. 
False,0,"Yea , i kinda figured that . I think i have all those location , but i could be wrong ."
False,0,Fallout4map.com
False,0,344 is highest number I've seen. But apparently some placed are only accessible through missions
False,0,"All i can confirm is that i have 338 discovered locations , I've been looking all week but can't seem to find anymore. "
False,0,Thanks man ^^ just fast travelling around hoping to see something...it's getting pretty tough ._. Lol
False,0,Go to glowing sea I think 9 locations are past the borderline and the ship uss constitution is actually 2 locations in 1 if u do the quest and side with ironside 
False,0,Niiice ^^ gives me hope to find more but honestly I must be walking straight past these 20 locations..
False,0,I have 320 right now but heard 340-361 so idk its bullshit 
False,1,"Haha well then explore, lvl up and find cool stuff and one day those muties will be scared of you :)...in fact no I can't say that those guys ain't scared of shit they run at you with nukes..but none the less..embrace the unkown x) "

False,0,"This is kinda dead, I'm gonna do a Q&A see ya there"
False,0,Oh and tar walkers are a tribe in utah. Peaceful. 
False,0,NCR is spread way to thin. Holding to much in a little hand. 
False,0,Kimball blows but the Legion are sexist slavers. 
False,0,A tribe Caesar conquered probably 
False,0,Who were the Tar Walkers?
False,0,"NCR is garbage under Kimball, Caesar is mighty"
False,0,Yup ikr

False,0,I actually think that might work xD
False,0,I wonder if I can throw a homing beacon onto his submarine...
False,0,Actually it does run background just at a much slower rate 
False,0,"If you close the app it won't run in the background, just close it while your away"
False,0,Yeah they run out of food cause I'm not collecting cause I'm doing somthing then they get radiation 
False,0,Not enough food as well
False,0,Build more purifiers and assign people there

False,0,Loot!
False,2,Uhh decorations? 
False,1,Scrap 
False,0,Get the Blitz perk (9 agility).  It's insane.
False,0,I just take out the people further north doing that to save space instead of taking as much armor or any weapons. 
False,0,I don't have any of the melee perk or blunt weapons perk and I easily take out a group of raiders with my bare hands 😂
False,0,I hope they don't ever
False,0,God I hope not. I didn't think it was. But I didn't get around to down loading it yet 
False,0,"Thank fuck, saw people on here saying it had been patched 😔"
False,0,"The size one isn't patched, I think just the vendor caps glitch"
False,0,They did? Oh fucking shitttt
False,0,"You can do that trick where you out a bunch of useless guns into the work bench, grab them again, drop them, and scrap them unless it got patched."
False,0,Or*
False,0,Ahhh this patch I'm hearing about...has it just done away with mods of something? Doesn't sound very Bethesda to me.
False,0,Yeah size. Heard they patched the weapon scrapping glitch
False,0,Unless there's something I've totally missed there are mods on pc to increase settlement size but can't do that on console until mods cross over to those as well. 
False,0,Build a doghouse at your settlement he will go to it if you get separated
False,0,Thanks!
False,1,That happened on my recent play through. Got to sanctuary if that's where you had him last and check the dog houses. 
False,0,He will be at red rocket truck stop if you picked up another companion and didn't specify where you want dogmeat to go 
False,0,If you just got Nick he'll be at a settlement
False,1,He probably went back to the place you had him at last if he wasn't your companion 
False,0,"He'll prob be outside when its done, if not check Sanctuary "
False,0,"You know,I did abot 10-15 New Vegas playthroughs and I didn't side with the Legion in a single one,I know what to do after I play the hell out of 4"
False,0,Very shortly
False,0,I let them kill me the first time so I know how long it would take for me to die
False,0,"""Look its the harmless atom cult...what is that in thier hands....WHY DID I JUST TAKE RADS!?"" yeah. "
False,0,Exactly. 
False,0,I know right I was like ooooo atom people then they start shooting at me so I murdered and mutilated them all
False,1,BoS out ranks the Railroad. 
False,0,"I'm going to play through as all the factions though. I'm curious to see every possible outlet. 

Fuck you Bethesda. "
False,1,Yeah. Someone must die. It's kinda bullshit. Especially when you take down the Institute and one other group. I don't mind the Institute (kinda a hard pill to swallow) but still can't decide between the railroad and BoS. 
False,2,I never got why the hell the church was so damn violent in this game. They were passive in 3. 
False,0,Lol... North Korea tries to bomb the US... the international equivalent of suicide by cop.
False,0,Lol
False,0,Someone had to do it eventually 
False,1,"Because War,War never changes"
False,0,Yes because taking more stuff over would help. The Romans did that and it worked out well. So did the Athenian actually
False,0,Let me see your man boobs and maybe I'll like you America 
False,0,Damn strait👆🏻👆🏻
False,1,"Really in all actuality America should have never stopped taking shit over. We started as 13 colonies, in which We took, and then we went to war or bought the rest. We should have kept going a little bit more, and maintained the we are the biggest and baddest attitude, while enforcing it. I doubt we'd have so many problems Now. Now we are just viewed as spoiled, lazy, slobs and everyone just walks on us while the government practically begs for people to like us. We don't need anyone. What we need to do is start flexing our military power and tell people to chill before we got problems "

False,1,Well here's the secret..my nane on here is my gamertag on xbox lol Cyphus S
False,0,"First play through I only used dogmeat, noe second play through just using them for their missions..After that I'll leave them be..better for stealth when you don't have them with you having to tell them to wait etc does get annoying."
False,0,Chill cayd 
False,0,"Now that I have the Lone Wanderer perk, companions just screw me"
False,0,I don't use companions anymore.^^
False,0,No you dimwit
False,1,Hey cyphus you have an Xbox? What's your gt 
False,0,Play Danse Danse Revolution
False,0,Woah Cayd
False,0,Never you dimwit
False,0,South of Lexington you'll pick up a military frequency listen to it and follow the quest
False,0,Fuck with nick 
False,0,I don't know that you have to do any specific quest. I was just wandering and picked up the radio signal. It's Cambridge police station tho 
False,0,It's cool. Me and her got it covered. 
False,0,My bad lol
False,0,Would have helped. 
False,0,Oh maybe I should have been more specific 
False,0,"My best Legendary is my Explosive Combat Shotgun. It's retardedly broken.

It's a cool feature, but I hate how there's no consistency to who drops what, so you could get an excellent Legendary from a Roach and a shit one from a Deathclaw.

I also have a million pieces of Legendary Leather Armor, but I'm not Level 2 so they're useless."
False,0,"It's awesome that feature with the legendarys , it gives you the chance to get some damn good weapons , and a good reason not to stop playing , just keep playing until you got the right effect on your favorite weapon , I already got hundreds of them , just play on very hard (I don't like survival mode much) and keep on playing and leveling , in higher levels you get a lot good weapons and armor "
False,0,I've gitten oretty lucky I guess. I got a legendary super sledge. I forget its power tho. But I also fully upgraded it.
False,0,So are ok. I like them cause they are worth more and u can find decent ones. I found a .38 pipe pistol that has explosive rounds and does about as good as my .45 combat rifle 
False,1,"I'm not very lucky with legendaries...

3 legendary baseball bats
legendary knuckles
legendary combat knife
legendary rolling pin
legendary wrench
legendary walking cane

+ they're just the ones i remember 😂"
False,0,Ya i fought a legendary mole rat mother on survival and lost like no health xD (i know its a mole rat but still) 
False,0,Yeah. It's all about the luck of the drop.
False,0,"Killed a legendary deathclaw and I got a rolling pin, later two other legendaries dropped a pool cue and a baton"
False,1,Just another collect able for me. I liked the concept though
False,0,"Yes and no. It's kinds a cool add on. But then again, they seem to only drop pointless shit...

"
False,0,"I hate myself for failing his last speech check, now he's still just holed up in his bunker"
False,0,He is a total beast when fighting the institute in the last mission 
False,0,I agree with that too. 
False,0,Nah he's too crazy for me
False,0,He's old. Would get in the way if anything. 
False,0,It doesn't make sense that you should contract it just because your companion is hit. I wasn't hit at all and still contracted it. Lame ass followers. >_<
False,3,I don't want aids I can't bang piper anymore because I have fallout aids how would you feel when no one can touch you
False,1,OH.. Well I'm still going to massacre those fuckers just for fun...
False,3,literally -10 hp. get a grip... 
False,1,What the hell?! How can I know if I contracted the disease?? Fucking ginger I'm going now to kill every fucker in vault 81 if I have it!!
False,0,It's really stupid I read that even if your companions get hit you get it
False,0,"Yeah, either did i. But I did read up on if and you're right. It's bullshit. It's completely incurable with the only exception of one cure that you need to (or at least should) use on a kid. It really is Fallout aids."
False,0,I didn't get the disease while doing the mission
False,4,Gingers have no souls. You should have saved yourself.
False,0,What does it matter if he is gay or not
False,0,but you need to do a few missions for the bos before you get that mission with Danse 
False,0,"spoiler****

the power armor is permanent on him until you reach a quest where maxson tells you to find him and Danse is at a bunker. then he doesn't have the armor on"
False,0,R u gay is the question 
False,0,Kill him and take it off simple as that
False,0,Good. Attempting to download that damn update for a second time. Yourself?
False,0,Noce thanks peeps. How r u today ssj
False,1,I believe so. I used my friends. I think it was a Samsung headset. But it did work
False,0,I don't see why you couldn't...but not completely sure
False,0,lol I'd take his advice too^^ or hang back and bring a lot of ammo
False,0,the castle is just like taking over another settlement for them. basically 
False,0,"Yes that's right ^^ but that won't change anything for any other faction so if you want tge castle just do minute men missions until you get there ;). My advice for the first time going to the castle..take some powerful weaponry and good armor ;)
"
False,1,"you don't need to side with the minutemen the to get the castle. the minutemen are neutral. it's basically you side with the bos, institute or railroad. but you have the option to go with the minutemen if you don't want to join the other three. "
False,0,So the only way to get the castle is to side with minute men 
False,0,Besides that you can join all factoons once you meet their leaders lol 
False,1,"When you are up to a certain quest related to the brotherhood of steel and the institute, you must choose one or the other and the game will let you know this by coming up with a message telling you that your about to become hated by the other faction. 

However besides picking and choosing from the brotherhood and the institute, once you have passed that stage where you get the message and done the quest afterwards..you will get a selection of quests..seemigly one from each faction and these missions will initiate the finale and in doing so align you with that faction. So to sum up

You will not pick your end faction until after you have decided whether you will fight the institute or the brotherhood and you have completed that quest. But beware..siding with the institute (which is something I haven't done) may leave all other factions hating your guts because they are villified in the commonwealth. Also remember that once you have picked brotherhood or institute...the next faction missions you get will be the finale' and once you start one..for example the mission for the minute man 'protect thr castle'..Once you start that...that's it..no going back..so as most of us know..keep saving. Hope this helped..sorry it's wordy ^^'"
False,0,when you get the bunker hill quest or whenever one faction asks you to kill another
False,0,*small spoiler* when you build a teleporter for a quest the people you build it with is who you side with then there are a couple opertunities to change
False,0,I honestly don't like the new perk system. I wish I could have skills beach :/
False,0,"Well you have to think about it..They made fallout 4 on next gen..it has guns...so you have the ability to look down the sights because that's how you'd use a gun..right? In fallout 3 you couldn't aim down the sights and in new vegas you could..but did that change how the game played as an RPG? Not in my oppinion..it just helped make shooting on the game a smoother experience. So if you play it like a shooter I guess that's how you'll see it..but many people don't play it for the shooting..many people play it for the immursiveness of the world fallout is based, the lore, and the characters..and THAT is what makes it more RPG...in my opinion lol"
False,3,Fallout new vegas was the best fallout...fallout 4 has become a generic shooter with a light touch of rpg
False,3,Yoh obviously aren't playing like I am
False,1,Yay witcher 3 boo that your disappointed with fallout 4..
False,0,I can't play it either...it gets me bored really quick.
False,0,They did this one has an extra row
False,0,Two shot semi-auto combat rifle 124 damage un modified 
False,1,"My long barrel .44. It's called ""the dirty"". After Dirty Harry. "
False,0,"Combat shotgun that shoots an extra projectile. 125 damage, and thats with no perks to up it"
False,0,Two Shot 44 Magnum with the bull barrel and scope ( 264 damage ) 
False,0,Or Kellog's pistol
False,0,Hunting rifle. Any variant but short. 
False,1,Deliverer
False,0,My small .44 snub that I named in honor of a guy from PSN. It is called Little PP Big Heart.
False,0,50.cal Two shot Hunting rifle with a medium scope...ooooooweeee..or my Two shot combat shotgun..both over 200 dmg x) 
False,0,My full auto assault rifle
False,0,Yes
False,0,They are not real. So you must be a synth
False,0,Yeah you need to go to the institute
False,0,Kool
False,0,"All of the full sets of heavy armies look cool, especially raider"
False,0,It's fine. Thanks for the suggestions. Both of you. 
False,0,"Its still some good armor, some of the best other than metal"
False,0,"Oh that's my bad, sorry"
False,0,I know of the BoS and the star. I thought you were implying that there were more. 
False,0,"I think the only symbols are the BoS or a star, but its still cool to me"
False,0,Heavy is 101 energy and damage resistance
False,0,You said you could put symbols on the chest? 
False,0,Sturdy is 75 energy and damage resistance 
False,0,A full set that is

False,0,"And that spoiled it for someone, I'm sure, jackass."
False,5,Well seeing as you killed the BoS and they were his friends and family he probably got mad and left
False,0,Get Reformed stealth suit next
False,1,Hahaha ^
False,2,Hmm that's cool I didn't know now I know who to avoid muwahahaha
False,5,"To be exact his username is Theslitherysnake... forgot the ""the"".."

False,3,when will the update to see our older posts and posts we have commented on be out??
False,1,Kool admin
False,1,Thanks captin that shits annoying
False,2,What the hell news for me
False,0,In the basement....
False,1,It does its behind some sign that say don't touch it's below some catwalks
False,1,It's at corvega assembly plant.  On one of the ground floors it lead to a stash I think. 
False,1,Corvega plant. 
False,0,The charger i mean
False,0,Lol no
False,0,Did you power it with the orange..?
False,0,Oh and about my battery... its safe...i brought it to the power something i forgot the name
False,0,Thx
False,0,Cypus can iadd you on xbox
False,0,No
False,0,Do i need to max out the local lead perk.
False,0,Oh yeah and local leader...durp
False,0,"Go into your workshop mode and select a settler you want to use for a supply line, you'll see the option at the bottom next to creat etc. Say you have all of your junk at Sanctuary and you want to be able to use those same resources at Red Rocket, you would need to create a supply line going from Red Rocket to Sanctuary..hope that helps ^^"
False,0,Is this No-Bark Noonan?
False,0,I'm not sure Gaurdian understands what's going on with the Orange..at least that's my professional oppinion.
False,2,Ok?
False,0,"It doesn't really bother me since I've never given her any ammunition and she seems to be using them no prolem. I just have to keep stealing the Fat Man from her or she goes crazy. 

For example, I was pickpocketing a guard who then turned hostile. Guess who got a mini nuke to the face?"
False,0,Oh. Have you thought about giving her a weapon and assigning it. That might fix it
False,0,She defaults to a laser rifle for long range and melee/bare handed for close range. 
False,0,"Neither, Kate. She just has a habit of looting bodies all around. "
False,0,"Did you assign her a weapon or are you just putting stuff in her inventory?
The other companions have assigned we weapons but seeing as she used to be a Mrs,Nanny she probably doesn't have one"
False,0,"Alot of my followers now seem to loot bodies a lot more, possible been updated? "
False,0,So i can give a FAT MAN and 1 mini nuke to a guard and he would go on a rampage if raiders come? But he wont anyway i have 109 defence and no one have attacked the castle before
False,0,Nice thanks ^^
False,0,I watched a video about that they said to give them one bullet and it should be infinite for settlers at least haven't tried it with companions
False,0,Question kinda related to companions and weaponry..if you give a settler/companion a weapon can you still just give them a minimum amount of ammo (say...5?) and they will still just have infinite to use? Hope that makes sense..and apologies for putting a question in your topic ^^'.

False,0,Haha
False,0,"I was more of a mobster in it. I first accepted the bribe,raised it,took it and then shot down the baddies"
False,1,Everyone blew me off :(
False,0,Also I'm on Xbox One so it's possible it may not work that way on PC and PlayStation 
False,0,Unless they just fixed it with the patch I haven't let my meter deplete completely for a few days now so maybe they did if so sorry for the inaccurate advice lol
False,0,It doesn't give me any materials if the meter is empty and a few of my friends have said the same thing
False,0,The first part of what he said is wrong you still keep the materials when the size gets to empty 
False,0,Oh and if you drop weapons it drops that meter down fast . . And it seems like the more mods the weapon has the faster/more it drops the meter 
False,0,Okay be very careful doing that because the meter in the top right (settlement size meter) it will go down and if it gets to the point where it's empty you won't even get the materials from what you're scrapping . . . That is the way to shrink your settlement size so you can continue to build it up larger 
False,0,Yup that's where I am I used the railroad to build my stuff cause I was right there already but it doesn't matter who you have help build the stuff I dont think 
False,0,"It will tell you mate, 

Before the end mission properly begins it tell you you will either become enemies with the institute or everybody else and ask if you are sure etc. "
False,0,"Same, thats what i have been doing. I choose the BoS to create my teleporter into The Institute, so i hope that didnt matter"
False,0,Lol I hope that helps . . . It's what I'm doing . . . I like to do everything else like side quests and stuff then do the main story and its alternate endings 
False,0,I think you can just go until it pretty much says your going to piss some other faction off and that's where i stopped so I could do as much as I could for each of the factions . . . But I think you also need to already have joined more than one of them for it to even do that
False,1,And the Minutemen are there if you make all the other factions mad or you don't like them^
False,1,"The institute is the ending that's more emotion entered

BoS is just ""fuck everyone we're warlords"" ending

Railroad is more short term goal centered than the institute. 

I finished with the institute in the end"
False,0,Ahhh ok i thought id have to run in and join after i did that 
False,0,Do it. You don't join until a bit later and you have the decision to infiltrate whenever after deciding the chip or whatever 
False,0,Then u gotta go in and screw everything up as usual it would just be cool to learn what really happened to them after the games they were in ended 
False,0,My bad it just gets annoying and yeah anything can happen in these games im saying they join forces but obviously one of them is going to screw the other over when it comes down to it it would just be awesome to see those guys who are power houses join forces 
False,0,"Haha I second that. But to answer your question..I think that's one of those scenarios that's a never say never type deal..but I feel like the idea behind the war against China and America in the Fallout universe is to show that by the time the bombs fell..Most of the world was divided..even more so with the world's superpowers..I.E China and America.

But I suppose the Game is based pretty heavily on deception...I mean literally all you need as an example is the vaults. "
False,0,Don't take it so personally damn 
False,0,And just answer the fucking question don't correct me 
False,0,Actually the descendants of the pre war government there bud so yeah still the US government in my book  
False,0,The enclave isn't the old government. They were started before the war for post-war government. They were only known about in the last month before the bombs fell. 
False,0,Thank you cyphus that helped alot

False,1,And if you don't know where swan park is..someone in diomand city will randomly put the location on your map when they start talking to you..usually a guard. 
False,1,*On the ground besides the protectron*
False,1,Go to Swan Park..look for the fountain and the protectron next to it. Beside the protectron you will see a red coloured brick line connected to the pavement...that my friend..Is the Feeedom Trail..just follow that and you'll get there eventually...watch out for super mutants.

False,0,Huh?
False,0,They're pretty good. I clear out my work benches every time I visit. Usually have 2 scavenging posts and they'll have like 30 random junk collected in a day or so
False,0,"They're decent. It's like when having a companion search for ""good loot"" off of bodies or from containers but just junk items. If you want good junk items and such then make the first store listed in workshop, they sell good stuff at those in general but that's the one that give junk items I believe. "

False,1,Dogmeat as a companion still activates the line survivor perk. So you get (at max) like 20% or some damage increase and 100 more carrying for yourself plus his storage and such. 
False,1,Piper is my bae <3
False,0,"In the southeast of the map you can not far from Poseidon plant there is a giddy up buttercup factory with supermutants in it. Clear them out and get to the roof, there will be a large yellow duct, climb on top and you can see a very large pipe that you can jump on, walk down the pipe until you find a hole, you can get into the pipe and walk through it and at the end is a steamer trunk with some goodies and it is surrounded by about 10 bags of cement "
False,0,Where is connie and whats shipment of stuff like what does shipment of stuf mean?
False,0,I believe there's some in Hardware Town
False,0,I forget exactly who but you can buy shipments of concrete. I think Connie Abernathy sells them.
False,2,"Yeah Sanctuary is the only place I've done the multiple house thing. Because it's hard attempting to protect all of them. Plus, when you scrap the houses, there's just foundations that are easy to build on. I build a bar on one, a market on the other, then put a artillery canon on one, and finally made a (nonfunctional) basketball court."
False,1,"There's a small quest (Idk if it's a side quest or unmarked quest) but there's a guy at the Slog that is trying to repair a Giddy Up Buttercup. You can tell him where the parts are, or you can bring them to him. It's in the Wilson Atomatoys Factory."
False,3,"Thanks fellas.

To answer your question, it really depends on the size of the settlement and what mood I'm in. I made a huge one building settlement on the island. But in Sanctuary, I have a few prefabs and some built housing. I may scrap them and just use the houses that come with the settlement. "
False,2,"@jjuice I think there may be a quest where someone wants one but not 100% on that. Otherwise they are just decorations. 
I have a room in my settlement where it's just a table with a knife on it and random bits of horses around 😜"
False,1, I always go to the Atomatoy places and pick them up. They replenish after a while and you just need to kill a few super mutants.
False,2,"The full Giggy ups can fetch a pretty penny. Besides that I usually keep the parts (legs, arms, or heads) and scrap them. They have a fair amount of screws, steel, etc. in them."
False,1,"Now, my question is, do you guys build giant buildings that house everything? Or do you build a bunch of smaller building or individual homes? I tend to build giant buildings so I can use a side of that building as a fence too."
False,1,Are the Giddy Ups just decorations or do they have a purpose? I bought a complete Giddy Up but have yet to see what purpose it serves.
False,1,Oh and that too ^
False,2,"Yeah that would be cool. But I don't know about structures you build. Because they are suppose to be rustic, and messy. If you could restore something than fine.

But I'd like to see a little more verity of building materials. Most of all, I'd like to level out the damn ground. So I can build a three story building, but I can't level out the ground?"
False,0,Use Space if you're on PC
False,0,Yea
False,0,The first 2 turrets actually don't need a wire btw. They're wireless
False,0,"If on console, Y for Xbox, Triangle for PS4 and not sure for PC"
False,0,"That's an interesting thought. I'll try it out when I get on next time. 
Thanks for that, the timing on the shipments of water is driving me nuts.
"
False,1,Guys i think when u say u leave for an hour and have less its probably because you are not fast traveling alot and the other time when you had more in less game time you might have been fast traveling alot taking up more in-game time 
False,0,"On the plus side, if your income is endless, you won't have to worry about jumping from settlement to settlement. One at at time."
False,1,True. Like I said I'm at the point of building the essentials and moving on. But yeah I'm close to the point where I'm going to build all my settles that get by and make them better. And yes. I'm guessing the more you have the better the changes.
False,1,"That's mainly why I said build a ton of them, obviously your chances of coming back to 2000 caps worth of water is substantially higher than what your chances would be if you had fewer purifiers. I have about 20 set up at my base now and it can be quite impressive with how many caps you can earn."
False,0,"Well, it seems like there is no rhyme or reason to it. It just makes purified water at different rates really depending on nothing. Sometimes there's alot. Sometimes there isn't. It's kinda stupid if you ask me. Ad long as there's more water then people then you'll get some. But how much and when seems like the question many have."
False,0,Hahaha will do. I find this to be a good way to make caps too. I'll look around on the Internet too.
False,0,"To be honest man, I have no set answer. Sometimes I'll leave the settlement for 10 minutes and come back to 90 water and other times I'll be gone an hour or two and only come back to 40 water. If you find a pattern please let me know lol"
False,0,How long does it take for water to replenish in the settlement's workbench? Because I go to Sanctuary and there'll be like 70 purified waters. But then I'll go back and only get like 7. So do you have any idea about how long it takes?
False,0,"Update: in the last 2 hours or so, I've made about 10,000 caps. The worth is real."
False,1,"Ya I haven't herd much on them. And I've only used it twice other than the first mission. 

1. Take out a crab queen
2. Found one on my way to clear a base and it was missing a leg lol "
False,0,Wear*
False,1,"I don't where power armour much anymore but having sets for different purposes help I.e. Carrying armour, Combat armour and Santa armour "
False,1,"I swear those motherfuckers, just because they have ed or td, they eat bugs in their free time and sleep on cats. It doesn't mean they gotta get us over ""encumbered"" with shitty, uninteresting and boring work... fuck that seriously... unless you are studying what you want."
False,1,Because when life gives you fallout you play the shit out of it
False,0,Too busy playing fallout
False,0,If you're not too far into the game you can buy armoured clothing from Tinker Tom and scrap it for ballistic fibre. Makes upgrading ballistic weave so easy. 
False,0,It's pretty handy for looking for certain rare materials
False,0,Glows red for me

Dunny worry though, you can always store it all and set up a trade route and change bases when you get local leader perk!"
False,1,Nah Do Minuteman Missiom And Work on settlement like the castle
False,1,Honestly i would build up sanctuary. Make shops and storage containers because you gonna need to store the cool shit you dind and sell the stuff you dont want.
False,0,"Hope there's no spoilers there, what do you play on?"
False,4,"Just take your time, focus on side quests first, search the map, literally collect everything. The minutemen story line is good for starters as it helps explore the map and get decent weaponary. 

Spend your perk points wisely, i reccomend scavenger and scrounger as this will help with getting extra junk from scrapped weapons and extra ammo from crates! 

Mainly enjoy yourself! Speak to everybody, get to know them, them drimk some whiskey, blow their heads off, strip them and piss on their corpse!

False,1,"There is a way to keep BoS, Railroad, and Minutemen alive. I'll find the link and post it below."
False,0,I kept the turrets until I realised that they kept killing my spot lights!! Yea definitely the worst so far.
False,0,Right. That's why I won't build there or hangmans alley 
False,0,"Yeah. You go in thinking, ""cool, premade concrete walls, complete homes, and turrets that surround it."" But it isn't spacious at all."
False,0,Dan disappears after the main quest as well so I can't do anything there
False,0,I heard if you go to the glowing sea and get enough radiation tou can cure the desease
False,0,You have fallout aids well done
False,0,You either save the boy or yourself in vault 81. If you save the boy then you will have -10 health all game its not that bad. Take life giver perk and it cancels it out sorta.

False,0,"Their future is that they'll go crazy and eventually turn into ferals. But they're easy to kill, might aswell use the knowledge that most of them have from the pre war era."
False,1,"I'll agree to disagree then, no point in arguing"
False,1,I hope they add the mission and put some mutated sea life in the ocean. Its not that thrilling walking around the sea floor less ur worried you will be attacked. I want to be attacked while swimming.
False,0,May not become dlc skyrim had some cut quests even once all the dlc came out. We can hope though.
False,0,We are finding all of these cut things in the game files and only to think this game was planned to be bigger than it actually is
False,0,"I noticed those creatures the moment I came across them. Initially I thought it meant the oceans were occupied by them and it would be dangerous to swim. Similar to how Skyrim had underwater creatures. It's a shame, hopefully they do add it back."
False,3,I wish they had more quests in general
False,1,"Interesting,I hope they will add the quest in a later update or DLC"
False,1,I doubt it ^ there was cut content in New Vegas that never made it to DLC but I guess it's possible...
False,2,"Teah. I'm guessing it's going to be a DLC. Most of the work is done already. I.e. harpoon gun files exist. So do these creatures scattered around the shores. I know that in Gameinformer, they were going to cut settlement building if they had to cut something. At least according to someone from Bethesda. Maybe settlement building took up so much time that one quest wasn't finished? Anyway, I'm happy them kept settlement building. If i have to sacrifice one side quest for it, I'm fine with that. I still see a future dlc."
False,0,they probably would have made the mission so you can only do it with your aqua boy perks maxed out or something like that 
False,3,Maybe saving it for dlc?
False,0,XD I need to experience this!

False,0,Damn shame.
False,0,Hahaha yeah. South Park is always very clever. Especially including all this current event stuff on the gun laws in America. It was pretty smart.
False,2,"Yeah even the part where the power goes out and they're talking and she says to just smile when the power comes back on is taken directly from that movie. It's pretty good but REALLY slow. I suggest you see it

False,0,Hahaha it is? Haha just seems like great timing to me. I keep thinking the adds were synths hahaha.
False,1,Yeah it's pretty funny. The part with Jimmy and the girl is actually based off of movie from last year about a guy and this robot chick. I think it was called Dues Ex or something

False,0,the imgur app allows you to upload pics and then you can copy the url on here ... not the same as in app but it gets the job done.. and it doesn't just pop up you'll need to select the convo then the image url

False,1,"I wouldn't mind having a direct messaging system. It would be nice to be able to send people help or advice privately if it was going to contain spoilers so spoiling major details could be avoided.

But.... I could also see that going badly. It would give people a way to send hate and troll people one on one instead of in a public space."
False,0,That would take too long. They have to run the other apps and there isn't that many staff. But it's a good idea

False,0,Yeah a pipe pistol.
False,0,38 ammo is mainly for crude pipe guns.. Which is crap. Don't think anything good can come out of 38...
False,0,I am not sure about how that works. Apparently you assign a settler to the scavenging station and they will gather more resources from what I've read.

False,0,I've also waited days on end and even tried following them to make sure they don't die. The Scribe just suddenly vanishes and Larry just walks back and forth.
False,0,I have my weapon and armor emporiums there. They're two of the traders that you can meet randomly. 
False,0,Also if you just sent the settlers there from somewhere else it takes them a while to walk to the designated settlement 
False,0,"Set up a trader outpost . . . Problem
should go away quick"
False,0,"I killed Quinlan's cat just so I know what happens, I was utterly decimated by the whole crew of the Prydwen "
False,1,"Lol ""dead cats are never messed up""
Dead cats are messed up and you know it."
False,0,"""Moria brown don't know shit""-eon for pres 2016"
False,0,Did not give 2 shits
False,0,Cool Where at I'm totally going to see it lol 
False,0,There is a photo of a cat (post war) in new vegas sooo....
False,1,"Would have been fun to see a big mutated cat of some sort, like a glowing giant siamese lol"
False,3,"In the wasteland they are extinct. Basically only dogs are left according to lore (as I understand it) but that said, how many ""thought to be extinct"" animals have made comeback appearances in the past 5-10 years (IRL)? It's always possible. And who's word are we taking? Moira brown? She don't know shit. "
False,0,I thought there were a million places they could have hidden and survived. There's every vault or cave system and the sewers. Cats are crafty I think they would make it. And I've never heard any reference to them being extinct but I've only played the Xbox games so I'm not a scholar on the older games. Just what I've read in the timeline. 
False,0,"I got kinda annoyed. Cats have been mentioned to be extinct multiple times throughout the games. Granted, maybe one of the Commonwealth vaults had a few stray cat get into it."
False,0,Reginald's suit for the win. I use that and a pair of glasses for an extra 4 points. 
False,0,I do the same thing with reginalds suit
False,1,"I have a hat, glasses and a dress for a total of plus 4 charisma."
False,2,Or just quick save and try again. Always works
False,0,Nice
False,0,Byyyye*
False,0,Byte
False,0,I get you.
False,0,"Anyways, it was nice talking with you. I need to go, I am literally sleeping with an eye open. See you around."
False,0,Oh yea no doubt about it but when your right people tend to follow the smart persons word or I mean the right persons words. You know what I mean >~>
False,0,"You won, thanks to some others proving the point and having your back. If it was your word against his ,he would've kept going."
False,0,Ha random battle speak
False,0,Ikr I was like damn this convo got real but I did tell him to kill himself so I understand the retaliation 
False,0,Who would have said it would take such a turn.
False,0,It was an automatic response in my brain thinking he's leaving the chat so I was saying goodbye to him plus I like to use old stuff like broski or what's poppin sloam idk how to spell it but yea it's like fun on a bun
False,0,Yes metal beard that where I'm from. Apparently poopbags is a few hours south of me.
False,0,815 area code? Northern Illinois?
False,0,That pic tho 
False,1,For sure 👊🏻👊🏻 
False,1,Bruh Vault 815 is where it's at!!!! ✊✌
False,0,I wish there was an interplayer trading system. I'd gladly give up a lot for more copper.
False,0,"Lol tell me about it I have over 20,000 adhesive . . . I'm a major hoarder in fallout "
False,0,I have a surplus of almost everything other than copper. :(
False,0,Vegetable Starch is your ally.
False,0,Lucky
False,0,How
False,0,I wish I had some fucking adhesive I use too much
False,0,Build more
False,0,Same. I need oil

False,1,That very first inocent person you kill because you like there gun :) 
False,0,Jet packs. And the uss constitution. Fuck and so many other things lol
False,1,Blowing the Institute to oblivion
False,0,Yeah the starting along with my excitement about the fact that I'm actually playing a new Fallout. Then the Fort Strong quest was pretty cool too.
False,0,Killing the badass institute guys (I forgot their name) which have a stealth boy.
False,3,Starting the game first time
False,2,I always enjoy watching dog meat rip someone's throat out :) it brings a smile to my face lol 
False,0,Go in to workbench mode or whatever it is and hit x on the settler you want to assign to it then press a on the artillery 
False,0,Keep working on Minutemen quests
False,0,Got builders round doing a conservatory for us and I walked passed cackling like a maniac. Needed that.
False,0,Her dead body is on the road as a trophy
False,0,10/10
False,0,Calm down man
False,0,Reading* wtf I didn't type readying!!
False,0,"Omg yes, couldn't stop laughing my ass off on the train readying this XD"
False,0,Am I the only one who has never had Sanctuary Hills get attacked?
False,0,that's just beautiful 
False,0,I'm over here at work laughing my Fucking ass off. Toooooo funny!!
False,0,u can just build a stair and push it down to the ground
False,0,Sad days indeed. Oh well purified water it is.
False,0,Or if you have disc copy you could always re do the download and have version 1.1 since that's what there shipped with 
False,0,"Yep. 
Prob the best way to get caps now is with purified water or mutfruit farms "
False,0,Yes.*sobs*
False,0,No
False,0,"They don't need fuszion cores, atleast they didn't pre-patch. I am not sure about the new version"
False,0,No
False,0,Thanks guys but before the conversation I just used a jet and a psycho and went into sneak with my sniper and destroyed that fool
False,2,Yeah i told them to kill me first. You need very high charisma though.
False,0,Scaring the raiders crew is a hard speech check i think
False,0,"Yeah, if you can pass a speech check and tell them to kill you first, and kill em quick so Kent won't die"
False,0,"You must scare the raiders crew, after that they will run away, as they do this shoot the raider holding Kent hostage."
False,0,Ok
False,0,Well I just learned that they have admins on this sight so they got that covered unless they need more which might be the problem
False,0,"They could monitor or like scan the pic to see if it is bad 
Something like that maybe"
False,0,I mean yea I know what you meant but I was think about the other population of this app that would use it to be asses
False,0,Oh lol
False,0,When I was talking about posting pics about fallout I just wonted to see what people have done
False,0,Daxter I like your use of simplifying your words
False,0,I don't I have the game
False,0,"That would be nice
I think they need the system of allowing to people to view their posts from their profile with the option of having me notifications for each individual post like and a follow button for other posts that aren't yours"
False,0,Ya so u don't have to scroll and look it
False,0,Yeah the stores are only open from like 8am-8pm something dumb like that so if you're trying to trade and it's not between those times just sleep/wait it out 
False,0,Keep in mind that they do need to sleep at night that may be your issue?
False,0,I've never had issues after j assigned them to it 
False,0,dont lie to the community
False,1,You're halrious. ... Har Har 😐
False,0,"It was at 40 at one point, stop stalling"
False,0,Maybe I haven't noticed anything different except the fix where the button for picking up items in the container is now the same as your activate button
False,0,But yeah the assault rifle is all I know that uses the 5.56 rounds
False,1,Uhh just putting it out there the Gauss rifle and the last minute (legendary gauss rifle) both use the 2mm Electromagnetic Cartridges definitely not the 5.56 Rounds 
False,0,The last minute
False,0,Ok thanks 
False,0,I think assult rifle is the only real option as far as 5.56mm
False,2,5.56 is also for assault rifles.
False,0,Nvm
False,0,Didn't get it
False,0,And don't forget about phsyco
False,0,Killing the synths and all that.
False,0,That shits gets her off mate.
False,0,Or whatever people call it
False,0,I texted you
False,0,Kate
False,1,"na chill, ""she'll always be there for me too"" her words lol ... I wonder how many of ya she fed the same line ... tear"
False,1,She's actually bi

But i really enjoy using my serrated + electrified chinese officers sword! 

Also the Shishkebab is a let down!"
False,0,Np
False,0,Still worth it. Seriously thank you it was driving me up the damn wall 
False,0,Its a small chance tho :/
False,0,"^^ OMG thank you I was trying to figure out how to send enemies flying!!
^ thanks I couldn't think of the name lol"
False,0,"Rockville Slugger: aluminum baseball bat with saw blades, 40% less AP cost.  It's my main weapon"
False,0,Shem Drowne Sword or Kremvh's Tooth I love them both . . . But that bat is a whole different story I tend to scream AND THE CROWD GOES WILD every time I send and enemy flying haha 
False,0,Furious Power Fist
False,1,"2076 World Series Baseball Bat, sends 'em flying"
False,0,With costume 
False,0,I suppose it depends on level but I got a legendary gunner general with four gunners taking on a legendary alpha deathclaw and a legendary glowing deathclaw. Good few minutes entertainment then pop down to finish them off and loot the legendary items. Perfect way to start the day. 
False,0,That was the best raiders vs deathclaws 
False,1,Doing this right now so far there are 3 raiders a death claw and a glowing death claw
False,0,Go for it Gosnin. Post the results up here. 😉
False,0,hehe certain death on survival.
False,0,Thats fun lol
False,1,"Congratulations, you played yourself. Jetpack is less frustrating. And how do you get it with no jetpack anyway"
False,0,Lucky!! (It's the dawgpound btw) lol
False,0,How did you do that?
False,0,Did you use the trash can?
False,0,I've now set a new goal for myself. To also get the freefall legs with no jetpack.
False,0,Very nice congrats 
False,0,Cheers
False,0,Yea that's what I'm doing. Keeping my good save for DLC than another save for a alternate timeline save
False,0,"Lmao true, I may just start a new game but still keep this game as well. Plus, I could side with more than one faction that way."
False,0,Just start a new game and be a hobo
False,0,"Yes, but I feel like it took away half the fun of looting things lol"
False,0,Because have caps is key 
False,0,N would be sweet.  Even captin in here ;) so maybe just MAYBE lol
False,0,Thanks tho guys for the info.  Precitate that.  Well lates peeps im out now for reals 
False,1,Yeah way too much water...
False,1,I'm guessing it'll be a DLC because it seems like everything is already in place for it. But I really can't say.
False,1,Yea they should tho bring it back. Too much water everywhere
False,0,"its not a dlc its a side quest
that got cut from the game
"
False,0,Awwwww that blows lol. They should bring it back. Super mutants r getting old lol n i hardly find deathclaws anymore. Wondering if i killed em all already 
False,0,Yea but look it up on here bro i went under n it read the backstory on it n it looks like theres a shit ton n yea i meant it Quests 
False,1,"Hence the ""Harpoon Gun"" flies. And the beach, mutated dolphins on the beach
"
False,1,It was going to be in the game but was cut 
False,0,any legendary can drop that gun
False,0,Legendary Chameleon deathclaw
False,0,Which enemy
False,0,legendary enemy drops are random
False,0,"Where is it
"
False,0,Lvl 90 still so much I haven't seen or done.
False,0,You can keep going for me I started to run out of stuff to do at 60
False,0,"true so true

"
False,0,Seeing *
False,1,I completely changed my character from 30 to 50. I used to only use power armor now I'm pretty much the suavest silver shroud. I think putting time into one character and setting everything is worth it.
False,0,Drugs will do mama in
False,0,Mama murphy does die tho bro.  Or well u can kill her off lol
False,1,"Well Marcy, Jun, Mama Poopy and Sturges can't die."
False,1,I don't think Provisioners can die unless you actually kill them.
False,1,I didn't care about the people really...just the supply route brahmin.
False,1,Me too. Luckily it wasn't near an important settlement
False,2,"Well thanks, I shat my seeds thinking the people from sanctuary could get fucked by Deathclaws"
False,1,It's a random event 
False,1,"Yeah its a ""random event"" I think"
False,1,That happened to me really close to my base at Red Rocket. And I shot them too.
False,0,These radiant quests got me going crazy
False,0,Piper is that you!!!????
False,0,"I've been playing for 4 days and 10 hours and still have so much left to do, barely started the main story. Just joins bos and railroad, haven't taken the castle yet for minutemen. So many companions left to max out. Haven't found cait yet. Haven't even built myself a house"
False,0,"(And I am not going to, so yup)"
False,0,"Now that you say that, I realize it is true. I should do something about it."
False,0,So basically no one has a life here ha at least I'm not alone
False,0,I have played only twice for 2-3 hours in two weeks. With free afternoons
False,0,Lol I have over 100 hours on steam it's still pretty fun to me
False,0,But for real today I just got soooo fucking bored of fallout but I'll probably hop on tomorrow 
False,0,Ahhhhhhh yeeeeeaaaaaah
False,0,"And University Point. They both generators, an area for food, and other settlement amenities."
False,1,Agreed
False,1,"^I agree and disagree with you. Personally I prefered oblivion to skyrim, never played nv as I heard it was buggy as fuck, fallout 3 best bit was mothership for me and I prefer fallout 4. Eso I just find so mind numbingly dull that I would rather eat my own man veg than play it again.

This doesn't mean I can't appreciate the ones I wasnt a fan of tho, and you can see where they have learned from their mistakes.

All that said tho I only really play es games on pc for all the mods. I know fallout has them too but I actually prefer fallout unmodded."
False,1,"Yeah guys, but you all gotta remember that this is the first game for this new systems (PS4 and Xbox one) they always suck at first game for new consoles. Take oblivion first, then voilà they created Skyrim (for PS3 and Xbox 360). Now they sucked with ESO (first one for Ps4 and xbox one). Then take Fallout 3 (you gotta admit the game sucks or feels empty without the expansions they created later), then voilà they created fallout New Vegas !! Now they have Fallout 4 , and I believe their add ons are going to be a blast!"
False,1,And the new Vegas quest lines in the individual casinos were cool and some dark. Need more of that shit.
False,1,"I feel like there are less quest that involve manipulating people like ""memory lane"" and mostly just brutal killing."
False,3,"Yeah i agree with that. You can build a freaking tower. But get a few shovels and level out the ground? No..... no, no, no....."
False,3,Agreed. I just wanted more fallout. I love the level cap so I can actually have all the perks . I am disappointed about not being able to edit bits of terrain. (*cough* Spectacle Island *cough*) not like massively but a system you could do so.
False,2,Here...have a like *200 bottlecaps added*
False,1,"The thing I'm mad about is how much of the map is water. Plus, the fact that all the ends involve mass murder. Not that it didn't in other games. But this one just feels so unjustifiable.

As far as hype goes, I was just hyped for a new Fallout. If this game truly is just like FO3 or FONV I knew i wouldn't care. I was just so hyped for more Fallout."
False,0,Middle school an ur gonna have a fun ass time getting to it
False,1,It's under the kitchen table 
False,2,Middle School is the correct answer.
False,2,The only Vault actually in downtown Boston is Vault 114
False,2,"Just look it up on the wiki, there's no Vault under Diamond City. You can trust me"
False,0,Well idk who to believe
False,2,Malden is far North and West of Diamond City
False,2,"He's lying, its under Malden Middle School"
False,0,Thanks my nigga
False,0,Under Diamond City.
False,0,I miss the leg sweep from New Vegas lol
False,0,Hell yea sounds like fun times 
False,1,Yes please explain sounds fun lol
False,0,I believe pain train makes you able to knock down or stagger enemies while in power armor
False,0,Train train choo choo!
False,0,Sounds awesome. I dnt have that yet. Whats it do?
False,0,Hahah never hurts to ask.
False,0,"Alright, just curious. You never know, ya know? Lol"
False,0,Don't think so.
False,0,No its always T-60
False,0,It depends on the place for me. But it's a good idea.
False,1,If you look on the wikia under items. Theres a sub section for perk magazines. I usually check under notable loot when I enter a building so I don't miss anything. 
False,0,Yeah. Half of the settlers at any of my settlements don't even have jobs. Usually I'll just make sure they get enough food and leave.
False,0,"Lmfao! Settlers are borderline useless. Some of them at some of my bases are assigned to a shop, but they'll be in Butt Fuck Egypt just standing there looking at shiny shit."
False,2,"Fallout is meant to target your OCD. I've been trying to keep my settlement supply lines looking good on the pipboy. You know, not crossing eachother or anything. But, one day I look and apparently I accidentally sent one across the map. So, I attempted to hunt him down for about an hour just so I could change his destination. OCD as fuck hahaha."
False,1,You're not lying. I just want to complete my magazine rack lol. OCD is going off. 
False,0,Honestly it's hard to say one location. There are just so many! 
False,0,My idea is to add drivable cats
False,0,"Going to help the Brotherhood take back the Citadel 
"
False,1,"My wishes for DLC...

1. Settlement Pack - Adds more options for settlers and building materials. Maybe some new settlement locations or the ability to convert existing areas (like University Point or Quincy Ruins).

2. Enclave Revenge - Enclave remnants regrouped after their loss in DC, and attempt to invade the commonwealth. How you handle them depends on the faction you sided with. Idk, bring back the Enclave! Lol

3. Mutiny - The super mutants start getting more organized and stronger to attempt to take the commonwealth over. They unleash some FEV into the wasteland to convert others. You have to stop them from spreading FEV and take down their leader. 

Now I say all of this to say, but usually Bethesda adds entire new locations/exploitable areas outside the game location in their DLC's. So most likely the expansions will take us somewhere else in or out of the commonwealth. "
False,0,[To Jtabes] so basically going to Canada that sounds cool
False,0, As another dog companion maybe a mutant hound
False,0,DLC companion idea an Enclave scientist who had his brain transplanted into a deathclaw as a colleagues selfish revenge plan and which kills the scientist  and destroys their bunker .his likes and dislikes compared to your choices with science and befriending animals Plus who wouldn't want a deathclaw as a friend I sure don't like them as enemies .he can't speak until he write down in the dirt that he needs you to make him a voice  translator ( this last piece is optional)
False,0,I would like to see like a mountain range with snow to the north of the map!
False,0,Sounds like a good idea
False,4,Putin riding one of those mutated Dolphins with his army and secret police that secretly join your settlements and randomly take out real settlers over time. 
False,2,Woah bioshock!
False,0,Did i miss something?

False,1,"Hahaha no man I understand. That's how I was about this game. So, you'll know where to find me! "
False,1,We do.  Lol.  Ill still b around.  Its just ive been wanting that game since ive seen game play first day it came out on pc
False,3,But...... but..... I thought we had something special or S.P.E.C.I.A.L.?! 😢
False,0,Damn.. Lmao
False,0,Played for 7 full days already since release....that's 168hrs so far.....did 400hrs on oblivion\skyrim so not even half way through yet 
False,3,I haven't gotten the correct amount of sleep since this game came out.
False,1,"After I get home from work around 10:30 pm; ""I'm just going to play some Fallout for an hour, I have to wake up in the morning for school....... Holy shit how is it 2 am in the morning?!"" "
False,0,I need at least 3 hours... at least....
False,1,"I can spend a few hours just checking in on settlements, let alone actually doing anything "
False,1,Lol.. If you ain't playing for 4 hours or more you won't get very far!! I play 4 to 6 hours a night it's the only way!! 
False,0,Its always just one more hour. Then 2 hours go by. Lol
False,0,Totally
False,0,Only one? I play for like 15 minutes.
False,1,"I thought so too, as far as Green goes, but I find that I miss certain colored boxes when the Pip Boy light is colored. "
False,3,Actually the brightest lighting (most visible) would be red. The best for seeing in darkness would be green.
False,7,Or make it black so you don't have a screen
False,0,Woah! This changes everything !
False,0,Hahahahah

False,1,That's pretty sick bruh. You can't torture for the same reason you can't kill kids. It's something they don't want to be associated with. I've read stuff that raiders wrote talking about torture. But that's completely different then actually being able to torture.
False,0,so I'm guessing this Clint guy is at Quincy?  haven't come across him yet

False,0,I'm just starting to find ammo for it. I find more 50 cal and .45 rounds than anything anymore 
False,0,Yeah I had like 2000 ammo already for mine by the time I finally found it . . I picked up the scrounger perk early
False,0,I just found the gauss rifle and have no ammo for it lol and i meant it for more common rounds 
False,0,My Gauss Rifle is at 441 damage and drops anything one shot plus my sneaking critical shots do 5.3x more damage you do the math shits a beast
False,0,Uh wtf how did you not acknowledge the GAUSS RIFLE FTW!!!!!!!
False,0,lol what a great trick thanks!
False,0,Nah I just swipe it out from under them. If they have a problem with it they can talk to my little friend. 
False,1,Yup that's how I got the guass rifle and xo1 helm in the bos airship
False,0,Yep 
False,1,Oh I wiped those tables behind the Prydwen's trader.

False,0,"I chose to convince her to leave with our lives, and now Travis is taking about how she mysteriously disappeared "
False,0,Sounds like an X-File
False,1,I killed her too.  Sometime later I randomly ran into Mel while out exploring.  He was pretty butt hurt about the whole thing.
False,2,"Haha weird
I killed her too"
False,0,Girl in charge of the institute ? Ew. 
False,0,)
False,0,"Among many other things ( settlement building, redone gunplay, etc."
False,0,"It's hard to go back and find every instance of Father and redo it as ""Mother"". If one line is missed, it causes continuity errors. Plus, a new person would have to be designed and animated, and all the lines mentioning Father would have to be re-recorded.

I'm guessing they assumed people would be happy with character customization."
False,0,"Apparently a Woman can't lead the institute so that's why I made a different plot type of deal. But yeah, I bet it would be because of that."
False,0,"Good point. The Institute could be run by ""Mother""

I'm guessing because they would have to rewrite a lot of minor dialogue through the whole main story. 

Cost cutting measure?"
False,0,Ey that person went to surgery... left the carcass at my front door
False,0,Nah...
False,0,Shut up
False,1,Read my previous reply
False,0,Touchè. I just hate spoilers man. Peace ✌
False,1,And I never said I had the right. I said expect there to be spoilers on here and not to be butt hurt.
False,0,S3 I clearly said I put spoiler in my post. Chill out.
False,0,"It's common courtesy. I got things spoiled when I hopped on here. But it was during the first few weeks when there wasn't any information on quests out there.

I'm going to continue to say it. It's only right. What happens if DLC comes out? Are you still just going to spoil things because you think you have a right to?"
False,0,You can look for specific things just searching it up.
False,0,People come here looking for tips and help too. Using a spoiler warning is just polite.
False,0,Word yo
False,0,Agreed 
False,6,Then look at reviews. Not discussion boards. We're here to discuss. xD
False,1,Yes but people like to discuss other things not just the entire game it's like reviews for a movie your about to watch
False,0,Oh and on the mass fission building was really bad 
False,0,Yes and not .. Elevators hang for me .. And found a couple corners that are like a bad acid trip lol
False,0,"I've been receiving quests I've already done over and over, I walk outside to the second floor of a building and I fell through the ground and everything went white, Hancock randomly went hostile on me while doing the Saugus quest and etc."
False,0,Been running excellent on my xbone
False,0,Either did i. But lately I've had quests that won't give me a marker. Pissing me off 
False,0,"Nothing game breaking. Been running good. Few minor glitches - quarry guy got chased in the pond by mirelurks and was underwater for a few days. Self corrected eventually. Raiders caught in stairs (not under, not on.  IN), armor details missing so it looks like my combat armor was floating a few inches in front of me, Brahmin stuck half inside the house and half out the window in sanctuary, etc.. All very minor and somewhat humorous. "
False,0,"I honestly only ever had one and I'm,not so sure if it was a glitch or a super mutant just being stupid, but he was by a door as we were shooting each other, and he disappeared for a sec then reappeared and continued to blast me. Other than that it's been pretty magnificent. I guess maybe I was just used to glitchy as all hell Skyrim and then they brought this out and I was quite impressed"
False,0,Mine has also been running very smoothly. Alittle skipping during combat but not enough to cause any problems. I've been very impressed with the game and how well it works. After three I was expecting more glitches but they seem to have figured it out. 
False,0,I haven't had a single problem but one crash since launch. 
False,0,But besides that the only other major bug I've had was when I jumped into the quarry to get the pumps working and I couldn't move. When I reloaded the save I jumped in and was stuck in an infinite loading screen. Decided to play some CoD instead. Lol

False,0,Thanks tree I didn't know that last bit and I love me some paint jobs. Been on this app for 20mins and already laughed and learnt so much (even avoided spoilers!!)
False,1,"I would suggest hanging round the railroad till you get the deliverer and the ballistic weave armor mod though. Then you can just murder them all with a rusty fork if you really want. 
Be in good books with the institute and when you are in their facility walk around and take all there instruments in the labs because it's a really good source or aluminum. Then show them the rusty fork and get some sweet power armor from your brothers in steal 👍🏽 
Well that's my plan anyway. 
However if you do side with institute you get a pretty sweet white paint job in the end for your power armor. "
False,0,Just from what mr donut hole has said in going to play it safe and stick with brotherhood just in case lol.im a bit of a sucker for rare armour lol. I was thinking the brotherhood for that part anyways and if it dose not affect anything I may as well stick with them and suck up a bit lol  
False,0,Well I sided with the brotherhood.....I built the teleporter with the minute men and after the endgame with the brotherhood I got 3 legendary power armour pieces and another item the captain gives u the helm and the others are at the store I'm currently looking into the others now
False,0,"The only other faction is the Minutemen, but they're garbage. And who you choose for thag part affects literally nothing"
False,0,Thank you Arthur my friend :) 
False,0,"Well im not quite sure because I only just met the railroad, I usually just side with the brotherhood but if another option gets me better shit then fuck them lol "
False,0,Who you build the teleporter with does not affect anything
False,0,Depends on what you want to do
False,0,You just gotta get the hang of it

So 2,000/8=250"
False,3,talk about inflation.... iguana bits for over 1000$
False,2,"A currency strap is what holds the money together as shown in ""pre war money"" those in the US only come in quantities of 100 bills for any bill type above $1. Thus, 1 pre war money is $2,000. So 2,000/10=200. 

So that means 1 bottle cap is equivalent to $200."

False,0,Never happened to me either.....
False,0,Thats never happened to me. Have you tried taking it out and plugging it back in
False,0,I've never had that problem.... :/
False,1,Hmmmm..
False,0,You can get the perks to build your own jet packs.  
False,0,They offer MEGAZORDS
False,0,Jet pack at the ending
False,0,It gives you lunch boxes to open 
False,0,What do they do?
False,0,"""Fallout shelter codes below."""
False,0,What does it do
False,0,"If it does not work, someone beat you to it."
False,0,There are some places in the game where you can walk through a decontamination things idk where though 
False,0,Or craft refreshing beverage
False,0,Cook Mutt chops or go to any doctor
False,0,Mutant hound meat does the trick
False,0,"Drink water from polluted sources. Also, going to the glowing sea helps. Jk just go to a doctor "
False,0,Oh sorry then
False,0,Theres meat u can make as well that takes away rads n gives u health
False,0,Yeah..umm..i dont know where there is a doctor. Only one i know is in Diamond City and i havent gotten their yet
False,0,You can just talk to a doctor if you don't have any radaway
False,0,Yea he's a little shut head and will disappear for a while. Usually when you need him. 
False,0,Ok cool thanks
False,1,"The dog will randomly wander off. BUT sometimes in open world combat, it will randomly show up to help, then will wander away again."
False,0,U havw to check if u accidentally didnt send him somewhere or made him stay in one place.
False,0,Thanks
False,1,It happens along with the main quests 
False,1,"Yeah. But I want to play as the Sole Survivor. Not some other person. If i got to keep everything afterward, I'd be cool with it I guess."
False,1,"Why me!? I haven't done anything to you dorito! You know what.....ghoul you, I wish you could become a ghoul. You and your famiy are a ghouls"
False,1,I could see it being an add on that runs parallel to the main story. Maybe being a ghoul survivor from a different vault that gets opened when the Sole Survivor stumbles upon it and adventuring out to the wasteland from there. 
False,2,"Yeah. It should be a decision. I hope I  the next Fallout you can pick between Like 3 different character starts. I don't know how that would work as far a Canon goes. But like one where you are a ghoul, one where you are a vault dweller, or like a BoS member."
False,1,Like maybe an after-main story side quest. Or a DLC. 
False,1,"Yeah, but that would take away the radiation danger as a hazard and something that needs to be considered when strategizing."
False,0,I thought you would after Hancock mentions that crazy drug that turned him
False,1,I think you upgrade the base dmg. On top of the it is add the  bonuses from perks magazine etc.
False,0,Nah
False,1,Great against ghouls if ur using the berserk syringe 
False,0,*beat  it to deth
False,1,Paralyze a target and bit it to death...or get 2 super mutants crazy and watch them fight to the end..
False,2,Got 4 of em never used it. Supposed to be really rare but I got em stockpiled.
False,0,Ammo crafting is not that bad.. some of the effects look pretty interesting...
False,2,I didn't see the point. You need to craft you own ammo
False,1,No
False,1,Oh really? Well I know what I'm spending my next perks on!
False,0,Thanks
False,1,When it comes to those perks 
False,1,Shotguns count as assault rifles
False,0,*shit 
False,0,Oh shot haha good thing I have a 145 of them
False,0,"The ammo is fusion cores, you're just using all them up"
False,0,I think you just need to follow The minutemen. They only have a problem with the institute
False,1,Yeah. I read a little about it but I wasn't sure how. It made it seem like you need to follow very precise steps.
False,1,How? Please tell me
False,1,There's a way to save the Minutemen railroad and brotherhood
False,1," No, I went with the brotherhood. So much death. So much destruction. War, war never changes."
False,0,"Thanks I will try again, I will have to be patient lol"
False,0,"Check the bar on the prydwen (or maybe in the airport?). He's not there all hours of the day though.  I've got the same problem and this was the solution I found online, but haven't tried it yet"
False,0,Let me know either way! After Blind Betrayal you should be able to have Danse as a full time and be able to romance him! Good luck! 
False,0,"Ahhh well I have blind betrayal waiting to start, maybe that's why, thanks anyway, il try again soon, maybe he's glitchy or something. 😊"
False,1,"By the way, Blind Betrayal is the mission I was thinking of earlier."
False,0,Same here. I'll see if I can recreate the situation and find a solution. I'll let you know either way. Would you prefer a response on this thread or over Xbox Live?
False,0,Yep. 
False,0,Good point. Playing on Xbox?
False,0,"He's always been there after I did a certain misson, obviously with never having him as a companion it's not like iv sent him anywhere else. "
False,0,Hmm... So he said he was going to the Prydwen. Have you checked all your settlements? I lost Piper and Curie for a while. I found them wandering Sanctuary. It never hurts to check.
False,0,"Agreed. I posted on here, saying that it would be cool for the next game. But people just replied, ""so, basically Fallout shelter?"" But I'm with you man! "
False,0,That'd be cool. I'd like to be able to visually customize your armor too 
False,0,"Yeah, remove the never melting corpses."
False,0,Ok I guess I'll just have he sanctuary as my main settlement. Thanks anyways
False,0,Hmm that's odd seems like a bug.  Preston won't follow you if you beat it with the brotherhood
False,1,"Unfortunately, it did not work. I even tried activating a siren, but they are still in the museum, fighting off raiders like the first mission. Sanctuary still counts them as settlers, and Preston won't be my follower anymore."
False,1,"Ok, let us know how it goes! And good luck!"
False,2,I'll try that thanks
False,1,"Preston won't say anything different to you if you beat it with the brotherhood. He'll only give you the repeatable quests for The minutemen. Try building in sanctuary, that might attract them."
False,0,That deathclaw was tearing through them until he got a shot
False,0,Rip deathclaw
False,0,But the gunner got wat he deserved 
False,0,I didnt get hit by it but the deathclaw attacking him did lol
False,0,Please tell me a legendary raider was using it on you. And you were like wtf this guy is destroying me 😂
False,1,I got a two shot sniper on my stealth build.... so orgasmic
False,0,Also everyone is in stiffy mode
False,0,Ha plus that door isn't available to you right now 
False,1,"Yeah, I'd like to create something that people can contribute to. My X-01 post I update as people tell me they've found other sets that I have not located yet. But, it's hard when there's no notifications saying that someone's replied. 

I was thinking about showing how I set up a settlement from beginning to 100% satisfaction. That might help a few players."
False,0,"Yeah. You should create something so you everyone can contribute. I trust you will do a great job, but surely you can't know everything! Haha but you'd just need to keep the trolls out. 

Anyway, I think a guide. Obviously, what you are describing is this app. But maybe like a general guide from start to finish. But it's uo to you man!"
False,0,"Tips, item locations, quest tips/guides, anything really. I've done one on X-01 Power Armor locations and all Bobbleheads, but I'm happy to do more. "
False,0,No your mom jk
False,0,"What do you mean? Like general tips, weapon and armor locations, settlement building, or like a quest guide?"
False,0,No u^
False,3,Everything now get to work
False,0,A list of legendary attributes for weapons and gear 
False,0,I know the feels bro
False,1,"I do too! Sorry I took a while. I don't care how clunky or bad it might look (like in Arma games) I will like it, I am tired of UI animations"
False,0,But I'm guessing by the lack of commenting I'm the only person who likes first person immersion
False,0,It'll make first person so much better instead of that quickly switching to third person for a second crap
False,0,"Oh, that's was simultaneous"
False,0,Woah! That and clunky 3d animations in first person. Not that UI perfecto looking animations.
False,0,With all the animations in first person aswell
False,0,That would be cool......maybe if we could build a custom wep from the ground up with a custom paint 
False,0,Be able to make golden and silver versions of upgrades so it uses those instead of aluminum and steel
False,0,Armored core style PA customization would be sweet 
False,0,It'd be great to have any colour of paint to use. 
False,0,I want to create a war paint machete type of deal
False,1,"Yeah, sounds cool. I want a red and dark Deliverer."
False,0,On rare occasions they will send a gum ship to kill you but you can just shoot the wings repeatedly until the wing catches on fire or you could use the missile launcher and blow it out of the sky
False,0,"Use an automatic armor piecing assault rifle. The big one. With a compensator, drum mag, recoil compensating stock, and a circle reflex sight. "
False,0,"Better stay close to Super Mutants. So far, I've seen they destroying Vertibirds easily."
False,0,"Not necessarily. They'll be hostile, but you don't need to take me down  "
False,0,I see them very often
False,0,"Bought it pretty cheap, couple hundred caps. Either diamond city or good neighbor, can't remember"
False,0,Railroad gave me a gauss rifle.
False,0,You da man Kyle thanks
False,1,The institute ends better. And you can get a special laser minigun (whatever they're called) from the attack on the BoS when with the institute 
False,1,Yeah I got the deliverer. I'm just now entering the institute. I planned on siding with them.
False,0,Side with the railroad till you get the deliverer. Then side with the BoS till you can side with the institute then do so. 
False,0,Cool thanks man. I been procrastinating with the main quest cause there's so much shit I wanna do everything.
False,0,Yup. Side with the institute and take bunker hill. There'll be a ton of gauss rifles on the railroad people 
False,0,Cool Story
False,0,The right one 
False,0,There isn't one you ubnlock the door via terminal
False,0,It's in one of the nearby houses. 
False,0,You find it
False,0,"Intelligence will allow you to pick locks and unlock terminals, which you have to do A LOT all through the game. Charisma is great for speech checks aka intimidation/persuasion. Everything else is based on your play style. I went with a high strength so that I can carry a lot of stuff and have high melee damage"
False,0,I chose randomly then when i was out of the vault I did the specials glitch with dogmeat... And before level 3 i had all my specials maxed :))
False,0,Pick you special points based on what perks you want early access to. 
False,0,I put 10 into Charisma. There are a fair amount of speech checks in this game.
False,0,Wear
False,0,Charisma for sure. Make it level 9 then were glasses till u get the bobblehead
False,0,"Start with 10 strength, 10 endurance and 4 luck, the rest are 1 :D"
False,2,"Intelligence and charisma. Charisma helps a decent amount over the expanse of the whole game, but it isn't as needed as strength and intelligence."
False,0,So do all the intelligence ones first?
False,0,Intelligence
False,0,To the exploits
False,0,I read turn off auto updates and uninstall it and install it again just refuse the update
False,1,Why? It improved game optimisation and performance. Fixed a few quest and miscellaneous glitches too. Why would you possibly want to remove it?
False,0,I don't know!! 
False,0,Elder Scrolls online is still pretty bad so let's hope not.
False,0,Bethesda already thought about it and they aren't going to do it cause it would take away from the experience they're trying to make
False,0,I'm not saying solely multiplayer. Just the option. 
False,0,Never
False,0,I don't think so... Anyways I like fallout single player 
False,0,You don't have to break down the objects. You can simply store them.
False,0,So do I have to break stuff down or can I leave a microscope in there and still get the components somewhere else
False,0,"Not objects like guns, armor, or clothing. Only materials."
False,0,"They should make it so that if you transfer materials of any sort to a toolbox or whatever, they would show up in any toolbox you look in..."
False,0,"Yes, but I don't think the materials you store in one settlement will show up in another settlement. Materials are shared while building though"
False,0,He won't bother
False,3,As long as he doesnt bother us he is fine
False,2,You're a homophobic bigot why would anyone listen to you?
False,0,*supporting*
False,0,"Me? I am supprting, he's badass"
False,1,Oh god... what have you done...
False,0,"You forgot to add no (kate shaw plz). But yeah, I agree"
False,4,I'm still here 
False,0,Like if you don't agree^
False,4,No.
False,0,I never had any of those problems but now it won't show me any info in the top left corner like the amount of cap stash or if I'm givin something. 
False,0,Aaaannd they fixed the cap glitch.......
False,0,University point 
False,0,Look it up on YouTube and you'll see a tutorial
False,0,Look it up on the wikia? Lol. I think jack cabot gives you it  
False,1,Early next year 
False,1,Xbox doesn't even deserve to be in existence......that is all
False,0,Never
False,0,Deacon is badass .. I had him as a companion and equipped some 26+ black ops armor and some ballistic weave clothing ... he kept sweeping enimies by the leg with his gun lol by far my favorite companion.
False,0,Does that happen even if he's been equipped with armor? 
False,2,Oh really? I was wondering where he got a lab coat. Haha 
False,0,"Could try reverse pickpocketing a grenade or a mine onto him? Might cause a change in his scripting or whatever, when he panics."
False,0,I had the same problem on ps4 but he was in a diner
False,0,You can't 
False,0,Wait you can't move caps out of your inv anymore?
False,0,Makes it hard to roleplay...
False,0,Can't 
False,0,Two shot combat rifle 😍 108 damage
False,0,"Explosive automatic combat shotgun.
You wanna talk about overpowered"
False,0,Wounding double barrel shotgun.....bleeding damage.....extremely useful for survival
False,0,VATS 10 MM is beast 
False,1,My babe i called defiance. A two shot gauss rifle
False,0,"^*

I always do that smh "
False,1,You can do that with the deliverer as well*
False,0,A 10mm that uses less ap and charges crits faster. I can empty a full click if my ap is full
False,0,A staggering fatman. So my enemies disintegrated skeletons will stagger a bit.
False,0,You have travel with them to have it
False,2,Oh shit it's permanent? I just got them for fun! Now it's just more of a reason to get them!
False,2,Permanent!
False,3,Permanent
False,0,👍
False,0,Neat
False,0,Cool.
False,0,Yeah. I deleted one of those broken down houses in Sanctuary and build a shack that holds all my power armor frames. I have like 20 in there.
False,0,Thanks ethanc
False,0,I bet u know all about that 
False,1,Try traveling away and back
False,0,Rape them. Hard.
False,0,"The only people are dr. Amari and the detective and im shur i cant kill them
"
False,0,Get out of comat mode by killing everyone 
False,0,Killed him with some nuke mines.
False,0,I just killed him at level 14 with melee perks. 
False,0,"Dude you can have a gun that is perfect with that version of power fist, a cryolator, or a freezing weapon, so when you do a critical and the enemy freezes just run up to them an smash them with the power fist. Until dead or un-frozen. It works really well because it dose more damage the more you hit. I've done it loads of times."
False,0,Swans hard to kill 
False,0,"Yeah it was a ""meh"" prize to me. I just wanted to kill him. I ran into him real early so I had to run away. But I came back with a vengeance!"
False,1,"The big one is the ammo for caps glitch at vendors. Then I think the rest was small, performance based stuff. "
False,1,Oh sorry that's the holocaust
False,2,Oooooh you're a nazi too? How much of a troll can you be
False,2,Systematic extermination of over 9 million Jews 
False,4,Stuff
False,0,The ones you buy from vendors will restock. 
False,0,Are the ones you buy limited ?
False,0,"Mind that you can scavenge around the map, as well as buying things "
False,0,"Yeah, you need to buy, scavenge or scrap from the settlement area."
False,0,U run out
False,0,"Good, that guy was a fuckwit."
False,0,Hes no longer there... Only me and my rifle now....
False,0,Lord have mercy.
False,0,Maybee. I just wish to torture raiders like they torture others......
False,0,You sick fuck.
False,0,Deathclaws do not support isis. They eat anyone with extreeme prejudice....
False,0,Thats why my armor has radiation upgrades.
False,0,I want to behead every Damn one of those little Isis supporting bastards
False,0,Not really lol. Or behemoth super mutants lol.
False,0,Your arse woud get radiation though
False,1,Ok i will dunno why this posted 2times tho lol
False,2,It's not like they're fapping...wait actually yeah. Ok have a good time
False,1,"Put a chair in a room, when they sit down, get rid of the door and put in a wall, put a fire trap in the room and activate it to kill them (idea from Robbaz)"
False,1,Teach them they are maggots. Build a bell gather all settlers. Execute one in front of them and remove all water and food... that will teach them
False,1,Take out the belt then
False,0,"Same thing happens when you upgrade to final level or Big Leagues perk for melee builds. My bat which did  112 damage before now only does 57. I read that it is only displayed wrong and it does do the correct amount of damage, but I had to reload and choose a different perk because thAt bothered me too much"
False,0,Because I had the same problem but the gun I had equipped did more damage the lower my Health 
False,0,If you have a gun that does more damage the lower you have and had it equipped it will show different damage because your health. 
False,0,What about that night and day time perk? Does that have an effect on damage?
False,0,I see it on my xbox too it goes up n down. I think its because of a bug or the items u wear in game or the chems ya take 
False,3,"I actually haven't used any of the guns yet since the display changed, so it might just be a display problem. Honestly, even if the damage went down, it would only be lowering by 10 to 20 or so points. Still extremely powerful."
False,1,Is it a display bug? Do you see an actual decrease on the weapon's performance?
False,0,Does it just show that as the damage? Or is it the actual damage done?
False,0,In fallout three my fave parts were the subwayS. They were so creepy lol 
False,0,Grill?
False,0,That was pretty random huh
False,0,Go die you Donald Trump supporter
False,1,Just because I'm a girl you think I'd like the mall too...
False,1,That's so sexist to say... reported.
False,0,Kill her
False,0,Don't why you would rob her in the first place
False,0,Ssj3 u got xbox
False,0,Just check the supply line article 
False,0,"Yes. Only one settler can go to one different settlement. Go into workshop mode and click LB (not sure what button for PS4 and PC) and then click the settlement they go to. Afterward, if you go to your pipboy map, you can click a button to see supply lines. The ones that connect will share materials throughout eachother."
False,0,Have you assigned a settler to a supply line between the castle and the settlement you want to share items with?
False,2,"You have to assign someone as delivery boy like i think
"

False,0,Makes sense 
False,0,He's laying low. Otherwise he'd get banned
False,0,"He, uhh (whispers) I think he's still around"
False,0,Illumugly confirmed
False,0,HOLY SHIT WHAT IFBHE WAS MUGLY!
False,0,What!? Can't wait to meet him if he/she decides to come back!
False,0,He is like Mugly 
False,0,Is that another Badass guy that no one likes?
False,0,He's a synth btw
False,0,Oh and that other courier. His names escapes me.
False,0,Yeah. I change my mind. THREE DOG!!!
False,0,"Whitechapel Charlie!!!
He sounds like Gordon Ramsay, but a Mr.Handy"
False,1,three dog. *he never said it had to be from fo4 😈
False,0,"He's cool. Preston is my dude. 

Besides them, I think my favorite npc is that Mr. Handy at the Sunshine Co-op. The one that sounds like a hippy. Unfortunately I waited to build that settlement and he disappeared 😢"
False,1,Radroaches
False,0,Melee and stealth and kinda op rn 
False,3,Ouch. Quick saving build is the best build
False,0,"Where the door to the science center is, check around there"
False,0,I think that's close to a catwalk in diamond city. The one that goes to the water plant of Mr. Clean
False,0,Did anyone's silver machine gun turn into a regular machine gun after you completed the mission? Mines gone and I got some junker in my inventory (I'm assuming it changed to normal after but I don't really know)
False,0,Okay thanks guys
False,0,N make sure kent doesnt die like he did on mine. Lol
False,0,"If you do the Silver Shroud mission, make sure you go back and grab the replica machine gun and script. I missed them and couldn't get the rewards afterwards."
False,2,thank you ☺️
False,1,Couldn't have said it better.
False,3,go to the memory den in good neighbor. go through the red door on the right and then you'll find a ghoul. I think his name is Kent. talk to him and he gives you the quest
False,0,Cool. Was worried.  Gonna try to make extravagant settlements at each of the big ones.
False,0,I made the update yesterday and this morning i was still able to do the settlement size glitch... So we are safe... For now...
False,0,"But if I do, I'll post something."
False,0,"Hahaha me too. If it is, I believe people on the PC have modded past it. So, theoretically, when mods come out, we should be able to get it. If someone creates it of course. Which I wouldn't know why they wouldn't."
False,0,If you find out please inform. That is the only thing im worried about
False,0,I don't think so. I was attempting to check it out before I actually downloaded it. I don't believe it did bit I could be wrong. It doesn't seem as big of a deal compared to a caps glitch. But I really don't know.
False,0,New Vegas wasn't made by Bethesda
False,0,I know lol it was a joke
False,0,"""That Gun"" it was the unique 12.77 pistol in new vegas and was meant to be Rick Deckards gun from Blade Runner. I think you bought it inside a dinosaur "
False,0,"Still. They bought back the ""waser wifle"" 😂😂"
False,0,What gun
False,1,It's a New Vegas thing
False,1,"I already got the ps4 one this morning. It was supposedly supposed to make the game run smoother and at more fps, but all it did for me was take out caps glitch "
False,0,I'm sorry to hear.
False,1,The patch for xbox one came out this morning :(
False,0,Ps4 patch came out yesterday Xbox one patch is coming out later this week
False,0,"I believe was patch was in pc, later was patch in was consoles "
False,0,What was system was the patch on
False,1,"Not updating then, I want to have fun sometimes not be fucked by the wasteland on all playthroughs. Thanks then"
False,1,"I find those all over the place lol 
Hidden stuff, legendary enemies, quests and side quests!?"
False,1,We buy cool weapons and armors.
False,1,What does everyone buy with all their caps?? I've got around 10k and not had to spend any yet lol might just save up and buy the mod'd fatman from diamond city
False,0,Do you mean the one with the vendors that glitch
False,0,I'm Mr.Toast
False,0,Caps glitch
False,0,I did it without him.. You make more caps
False,0,If you finish the main quest first he'll disappear. Happend to me. Meh whatever.
False,0,damnit
False,0,It's a glitch reload a precious save or no quest
False,0,will do 
False,0,Tell me what happens I don't have my PC w/ me right now
False,0,how did such an obvious possibility skip my mind lol I'm an ass 
False,0,Save n try it out :)
False,0,If Mario can become a freaking raccoon I should be able to become a Deathclaw 
False,0,Death claw helmet? Boots? Clothes? There should be a whole outfit. 
False,0,They should have a deathclaws head item just so i could use it instead of those lousy kickballs
False,0,I was just thinking that yesterday after killing a glowing one. I had to settle for a screen shot
False,0,They need to add pikes that you can place around your settlement. Any attackers killed in the green zone auto mount onto pikes to warn future attackers of the danger of messing with my settlements. 
False,0,Baileys gayyyyyy
False,0,These comments are getting down to the BONE!
False,0,Goodnight. <3
False,1,I cant.... Ever since the enclave showed up in fallout 3 with trained deathclaws ive always wanted my own..... Maybee even a yao guai.... Or 2.
False,0,You're disturbing on so many levels. Get those sick fucking Deathclaw fantasies out of your head Goslin.
False,0,To the infinity and beyond!!!
False,0,"Its 16,000"
False,0,264 i heard
False,0,I heard it like 1000. I know it takes like 240+ levels to max out your perks.
False,1,"The actual level, cheers😊"
False,2,As of like what's the highest legit level? Or asking about the levelcap? It is unlimited levels
False,0,Has cait asked you to go there yet? 
False,0,Just keep going through the Vault 
False,0,no
False,1,>_> *
False,1,"Wait.... Is this a riddle?

>.>"
False,1,"Sorry, I thought you said ""what would you buy"" but yeah set up the shops like the other guy said"
False,0,Radroach food
False,0,You gotta set up shops and assign people to them
False,1,Easy... go to google and search Fallout 4 patch notes. Apparently it is just performance fixes and glitch removal.
False,0,Any gun can essentially become a sniper rifle (if you believe enough). 
False,0,You can make a hunting rifle a .50 cal destroyer. Gun mods are great.
False,0,"Another, follow the Bedford railway away from diamond city, bring a companion you will come across two super mutants and a dog let ur companion take out the bomber super mutant and In a litter railway building/look out there will be the other super mutant kill him and the dog and get the sniper he was using, it's actually a good one to long light barrel night vision scope .50 ammo, rips at about 97 dmg if u just want an easy sniper to get "
False,0,"Rarely at low levels, better if you mod a hunting rifle. Or wait, you can get Reba II from salem. That's the Northeast part of the map (top right corner) really close to the museum of witchcraft. But beware of the mirelurks."
False,0,You can mod a hunting rifle into one. Or go to diamond city. They usually have one for sale. If not wait two days and try again. 
False,0,Put all your 100% ones in your work bench so you can use up all others .  I only carry 3 or 4 at a time and store all full ones until I run out

False,0,"Okay so the quest marker should lead you to a wall with a deal next to it that says ""the freedoms trail"" which spins. Spin it so that the arrow on top spells out the word ""railroad"" (pushing the center button between each letter) and it will open "

False,1,Only the staff involved and the overseer was ever told of the social experiments that went on in any of the vaults.

False,0,It sure sounded like it.
False,0,I dont think he was

False,0,"Again, we already came to that conclusion but you're good for helping out "
False,1,Yes. You definitely can. I just read someone saying that they got a Super Sludge that had Freezing damage on it. Another that talked about a baseball bat. Now it's just the luck of the draw. Goodluck man.

False,0,You need to pick up a little red cylinder that has the cure in it. It's kind of hard to tell what's needed on the big table full of junk.
False,0, I think it's actually called Med Tec Reseach. But what are you trying to do there? A quest?

False,0,"Yep. You can destroy any faction you want, really. It all depends on who you side with "
False,0,Thanks then
False,0,there isn't a quest to destroy them. I think. but you can just kill em all on your own
False,0,I bet I can't

False,0,Yeah dude just go back to save before that lol that's kinda creepy
False,0,Wow. I don't know. Did you try replaying the Fort Strong mission? That's where I would start.
False,0,I'd just check with the vendor at Dimond City that sells clothes.

I'm cheesy like that ✌️"
False,0,I use The Deliverer because that's how I imagine The Silver Shroud... Hidden in the shadows... Not letting the villains know he's there... But if you want a legit SS get his Silver Submachine Gun
False,0,Bruh .44 end of discussion.  Thing rips holes threw these chums
False,0,And the 44 pistol...good idea.
False,0,She's also easy to fall in love with 😍
False,0,"Damn...I forgot about the machine gun. OK. New idea...machine gun and hand trow explosives. Sneak and chem. Preferably home made explosives..never explored that part of the game. I think there is a perk for that. There..problem solved. 
Hmm...do sneak bonus apply to explosives?"
False,0,Cait don't mind chems 
False,0,Haha yeah roll with Valentine! That would be the perfect companion. I'm pretty sure he doesn't mind chem usage either. I could be wrong
False,0,But I've been wearing the silver shroud costume since I got it. It's the best armor in my opinion.
False,0,"That, and maybe a .44 pistol. You detective style. Plus I'd roll with Dogmeat until you come across Valentine. It only makes sense."
False,1,"Getting into the who idea of an RPG, huh? Hahaha no good for you man. I usually make up my own little back story. 

Anyway get that Silver Machine Gun. I missed my opportunity to get it. But you just have to give that guy the fake one you find at the comic book store."
False,0,Exactly! I just do that settlement size cap exploit to clear up space with  my extra guns. Yeah but I just made a few trips to like the Boston Technical High School or the Wilson Atomatoys Factory. Places I know have a lot of junk. I tried to keep places like that in mind.
False,0,Not a bad plan! I've been picking up things like vacuum tubes and any technology oriented items and scrapping them when I get back to my settlement. I do that with weapons that I don't use as well to get materials for mods and such. No real reason to have 15 10mm pistols. 
False,0,"Yeah that's how I feel about shipments of wood. What I did to get alot of Copper, screws, etc. was get Strong, get some power armor (I upgraded the legs so I can carry like 460) and I also had strong back so I could fast travel while over encumbered. Then I go to place that have replayable enemies and just grab everything! Oh and I had that perk that let my companions carry more. "
False,0,Kinda like The Truman Show...
False,1,You know what would be cool... If they made a DLC that leads you to a preserved pre-war city/worldspace where no one knows about the war and that think they're still in good old Pre-War USA... And then you have to uncover the dark secrets of this place... Wouldn't that be incredible? A little like Alexandria in TWD... where ppl are oblivious of what it's like outside...
False,1,"I'm hoping they are as big as the DLCs they let out for Skyrim. Love the game, but it's lacking things I can't quite put my finger on. I know in Skyrim on both DLCs Bethesda released quite a few new weapons and a whole bunch more map, and a few other things. I'm hoping they do the same for fallout"
False,0,Yeah. I was just curious.
False,0,Probably like new vegas the story continues after you beat the game the main thing about broken steel was it let you play after you beat the game
False,0,I'm guessing mix of both. Like in FO3 there were the add ins with Broken Steel being an end - game thing.
False,0,Glitches and fps drops
False,0,I heard it just fixes the glitch that makes you able to never run out of room in settlements 
False,0,Thx 
False,1,Did they cap the settlement size glitch?
False,0,Yup
False,0,Yes sir
False,0,Institute. 
False,0,Ad Victoriam!

False,0,Kill both... Kill all
False,0,Neither
False,0,Since when is one month considered a few months...
False,1,"But wouldn't alot of people get Fallout 4 for Christmas? I think you still should. It's common courtesy. It only takes a few seconds. I'll admit I'll say something that I forget is a spoiler, but I don't do it on purpose. "
False,0,"Most of the new whiney people are gone, and the game is a few months old now. I'd say it's getting close to safe without hearing 1,000 crybabies"
False,0,I'll stop after January 6
False,0,Yep. I'm done.

False,0,Taco?
False,0,"Ammo one still works because I just did it and so does the settlement size one 
"
False,0,Great thanks!
False,0,It's good to see that I'm not getting any negative comments so far.
False,2,Well it's 11:43pm on 12/8 and I can tell you as of now the cap/ammo glich works.  
False,1,"As far as I know the ammo one isn't patched completely. Some ammo types seem to work. Often fast travelling away and back makes them work again. However, I have noticed that you no longer obtain the ammo you glitch. The vendor will not keep the ammo forcing you to purchase it back from them.

I recommend giving whichever ammo type you intend to glitch to your companion before performing the glitch. If you glitch ammo that you're carrying, the negative value will take from your ammo stocks. I lost over 10000 caps worth of plasma, so I learned the hard way.

Best approach is to only glitch ammo that in total is worth less than the total cap count of the vendor so you can use their caps to purchase the ammo without running at a loss. Eg. If .308 rounds in total cost 550 caps and the vendor only has 300 caps, this glitch will cost you 250 caps (if you intend on keeping the .308 rounds). If .45 rounds only cost 200 caps, you will make a 100 cap profit.

Hope this helps those who are having trouble with the glitch."
False,1,"No one needs to be roasting me if these glitches are patched lol. They can just go back and look at the detail, grammar, and description of all the glitches that I wrote about. That post took a long time lol."
False,0,"Yeah, I never did the ammo glitch because the cap glitch makes up for it. In my opinion... lol "
False,1,"Oh I am not doubting that, it's just ""people"" nothing agaisnt you  or them just common things"
False,1,Ik that the ammo one is patched
False,1,I don't think the infinite settlement size works anymore but the rest do
False,0,Fucking cannabis 
False,0,Lmfao
False,2,And dynamite goes the bomb
False,2,Boom*
False,0,"I just avoid all my settlements, if they have a problem with somebody I suggest they grow a pair and deal with it ."
False,0,"As with all the repeatable quests for all the factions, they will make sure there are two or three in your queue all the time.  As soon as you complete them, more will immediately be issued.  Just as in the BOS Cambridge Police quests, though you can fortunately avoid getting those.  I was sad at this decision by Bethesda.  I'd love to see settlements stop generating quests if you meet certain conditions, such as defense points.  Of course, I'd also love it if Wiseman, or the Abernathys, who have both said ""I'll never forget what you did for us"" would stop saying ""Are you from the minutemen?"" when I stop by the fortresses they now live in to hear about their latest complaint.  :)"
False,0,"Yes your right. Same ones over and over. So annoying
"
False,0,"That's not right because I'm averaging that many every night. It's one after the other. I'd like to take my Fatman and blow that damn hat off his head lol
"
False,0,i hate how he repeats quests sometimes. like ive had the ghouls problem at Abernathy farms 4 times
False,0,He only has like 4 quests and then he's done
False,0,I want to kill him
False,0,I believe that there are a couple quests in 81. Cause you gotta meet Curie and save the boy (or not)
False,0,Is there a quest to do in vault 81?
False,2,"get the overseers guardian in vault 81. it shoots an additional projectile
but when you're exploring it's mostly random unless it's a unique weapon"
False,0,I have a Fat Man that shoots two mini nukes but only consumes one per shot. I believe I got it from Arturo in Diamond City.
False,0,You're actually playing dayz. Rip your shirt and use as bandage
False,0,reload last save?

False,0,Well shit. Guess I'm not getting it then.
False,0,"But seriously, it is called ""Deliverer"""
False,0,"Yes, it is called ""Deliverer"" and I don't know how many people dieded to it...badumtsss. You didn't get it? I will jump out then"
False,0,Yep. It's a quest reward if you help the Railroad 
False,0,If u do mama murphys mission u give her a shit ton of chems n she croaks. Like a old bat lol

False,0,Apparently you can make her OD.
False,0,"What if you give her like 100chems
She should die right..?"

False,0,Can I live there?  Please?
False,0,I was thinking you could make a Mr. Handy or two at each settlement. Just because I found  Handy the box at Sanctuary Hills.
False,0,You can shoot explosive cats out of fat mans

False,0,"I initially wanted to find the locations of some rare items, so I can get over it fast and keep exploring. Now I'm here for the lore mainly."
False,0,"Just so I could indulge my fallout craving while I'm not playing hahahaha.

It backfired because I got hit with spoiler after spoiler.... my fault I suppose."
False,1,Having a raider leader on our side could definitely be a benefit. Just don't steal my stuff.

False,0,"Railroad is the most good moral from all the factions.

BOS just destroys everything pretty much but you get some good gear and power armor from them plus I heard it's the most fun.

False,1,Okay thanks
False,1,"When you kill legendary enemies they drop gear with a special perk ( legendary gear had the star). You can wear these pieces over certain pieces of clothes. I was running with bos under armor, with a raider right arm, combat chest, metal left arm, raider right leg and synth left leg. Piecemeal just means putting together whatever you got. The important part is that each piece of gear is legendary and gives me an extra dmg resistance perk. "
False,0,Okay thanks mate but what is piecemeal and how do I do it
False,1,Seem to be out of luck with the ballistic weave. ( don't worry me too) another good idea is to just get legendary gear and piecemeal it over something. Make sure to upgrade them. Also there's great Perks in the endurance tree.  Im running around in the silver shroud outfits and I'm doing pretty well on survival.
False,0,I've already finished and sided with the BOS
False,2,"Alright first off this is easy peasy. Spoilers 





Play the railroad long enough to get the quest for the first Dia cache. Once completed tinker Tom will give you the ability to use ballistic weaving. Now with that done grab these 2 basic clothes, army/military (depending on what special bonus you like) and the news boy cap. Once that's done you can mod both of those with ballistic weave at at mk.5 (lv 4 armourer) you get 110 physical and energy resistance. Those two pieces give 220 total. Now once that's done just grab your fave looking armour set like metal or combat and wear that. My heavy combat set gives me around a total of 330 physical and energy resistance and we'll as the BoS paint which gives 75 radiation resistance. Other than that I'm not sure of anything else that beats that set up besides power armour it's self. "
False,1,Look towards the railroad. I believe they have bioweave. Makes armor super strong
False,0,"Thanks. I kept doing them 1 for 1 order just so I wouldn't get too far ahead in any one alliance.

False,0,"Siding with the Minutemen leads to a planned attack on the Prydwen airship, shooting it down with artillery from multiple directions. Though the Prydwen gets destroyed, the Brotherhood of Steel refuses to go down without a fight. As the Prydwen falls, several hostile Vertibird gunships come straight toward the Castle. You must take up arms with your fellow Minutemen to defeat what remains of the Brotherhood once and for all. 

Once the Brotherhood of Steel is defeated, the Minutemen focus their attention on destroying the Institute. This involves betraying Father and planting a charge on a nuclear reactor that will destroy the Institute from the inside. Since the Minutemen become allied with the Railroad faction, several Synths are recovered from the Institute in the process. Afterward, the Railroad quests remain available, and the Commonwealth is free to settle their communities peacefully. Although this doesn’t seem to be a very ‘neutral’ way to go about these events, siding with the Minutemen may nevertheless be the easiest ending to achieve. "
False,0,"The Minutemen Ending
The Minutemen essentially want a chance to rebuild their communities and thrive in the Commonwealth. Thus, the Minutemen faction is considered mostly neutral, as no other faction seems to have an issue with them throughout the game. However, if you choose to side with the Minutemen after completing Act II, you will become allied with the Railroad faction, forcing you to take up arms against both the Institute and the Brotherhood of Steel. "

Fallout 3 and 4 are on the other side of the country so there's not going to be many references. There is a great story in this fallout just have to pay attention to detail. I think one of the reasons people think there's a lack of story is because there's no cut scenes like on other games except for the beginning and ""end"", and that to get the full scope of the story you HAVE to talk to people and not just skip everything they say. Other words to learn the full story requires a lot of patience. Which no one seems to have."
