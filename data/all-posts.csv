False,0,Oh. God to hear. He's more fit with his crossbow. I became mad with that guy and woman who took his crossbow and I would kill em if I was there
False,0,"He will get his crossbow, and there's a good chance he will have a date with Lucille...;)"

False,0,Ron isn't gonna make it
False,0,Yes
False,0,Yah I think he was the father figure to the group.
False,0,Maybe? Feel Dale would have been an real good asset even more at that time
False,0,They had to get rid of dale in order to bring in Hershel as ricks moral compass and conscience. I think if dale stayed alive Hershel wouldn't have survived for as long as he did. 
False,0,Those are some pretty tough ones there. 
False,0,"Personally My Favorites

False,0,"Firstly I want to apologise to Walkingdead11 for blaming her (?) for doing hers job. I wasn't supposed to make it sound as I did. Fault is mine and mine alone. Please forgive me.  Secondly, collective voice of fanclub wants to know what happens before February so be it. Need of many overshadows need of few. 
Knowing that Daryl gets his crossbow back males me pretty sure he's safe. "

False,0,To*
False,0,Lmao. Lori was def. too blame!
False,0,He had to go but I still liked him in the end. It was Lori's whore ass that kept pushing him and finally pushed him over the edge. 
False,0,I liked him at first too. But he def. became a loose cannon and he had to go! 
False,0,He had to die 
False,0,Walker because imo it would ruin watching the show for me. 
False,0,The recent scenes with Daryl on his bike is one of the times he have had a couple of hundreds of extras to play the walkers and right now filming the Alexandria area we have a lot of more extras coming in. ☺
False,0,Maximum of walkers you have had on the show at one time?
False,0,Yah every single walk and movement is rehearsed several times. The sounds are then put in after the clip is filmed. No I have never been a walker and I hope I never have to be. Greg (nicotero) was a walker several times. 
False,0,I know about the school it was on a YouTube clip  or did I see it on an amc extra 😁😁🙈🙈I'm not sure😳😳 an orthopedic resident I know told me about the list you have to get on too😱😱have you ever been a walker💁🏽
False,0,"A character, I would be scared of myself as a walker 😂😂"
False,0,There are the same walkers unless they are ones that are seen close up and eating someone etc. 
False,0,A character
False,0,Chericter
False,0,"Hi . Do the same walkers appear in other episodes or is it jus one off?  To answer your q DMariel, definitely a character that doesn't die off next episode. "
False,0,Probably dead.
False,0,Yupppp
False,0,Yaaaaaaaaas I do remember him omg he was driving the truck when Rick and the rest made it out of that department store
False,0,He was with tha group in tha very beginning of tha show he left wit his family on season 1 ep 5 when rick and tha othas went to go see bout tha Cdc
False,0,"Morales got hit upside the head wth a golf club, and some what thrown in a pit with walkers😳😳do I have the right person💁🏽💁🏽let me know👌(the governor killed him)"

False,0,"I kill negan

False,0,"I hope that too!! But I think it's too late for that, Carol is gonna be real mad now 😡😡!! Lol"
False,0,I think when Morgan wakes up he's going to have a change of heart💁🏽💁🏽he's also going to work things out with the group and kill as needed👍🏼😉this is my wishful thinking👍🏼😊😉
False,0,I did like Morgan but not so much anymore. Doesn't he die way before Negan in the comics? I don't think Negan will have anything to do with his death.  
False,0,"Late ...because is thé end negan (juste i can think no is officiel )
Because you lové Morgan  ?!"
False,0,Nope!
False,0,"Nope is imposibleul

False,0,"No Daryl no die XD is good ,  Daryl  is hurt 6x16 but i can't think is dead"
False,0,Srx Norman réduis contra 6x16 ?!!!!
False,0,Killing Glenn right after the whole Nicholas scene would be really dumb storytelling
False,0,Nah he will kill Daryl. Norman Reedus's walking dead contract ends after 6x16
False,0,Glenn because he does in the comics and Daryl is bæ
False,0,Negan rhymes with Vegan 
False,0,Because ?!
False,0,"Negannnn is better 
"
False,0,It must stink badly.
False,0,"Yea but she was a weirdo in the comics, haha. She's a lot different in the show in my opinion. "
False,0,I have an feelin. Remember there was a time where she broke down
False,0,You think that is gonna happen in the show too? I'm not too sure about that. 
False,1,Just survive somehow
False,0,It will be very messed up but it will all come together and will have you at the edge of your seats. Promise. 
False,0,😂😂😂😂 glad to help :) 
False,0,That's good to know 😊👍🏼I feel better now 😀💃🏽💆🏽✊🏽✌🏼️😊😉
False,0,I put up more spoilers there. Check them out! ☺☺☺
False,0,😂😂everything that will happen you won't be prepared for so....😂😂😂 
False,0,Omg😢😢😪😪ok I'm not going to be ready for that whenever it happens😢😢but ok😔😉😊
False,0,And don't be silly ☺ I love having you ask questions. It makes my job all the better. ☺☺☺
False,0,She may grow up somewhat but she won't be like a child. she'll only be a baby. 
False,0,I'm just growing weary of seeing her as a baby. It doesn't matter what age just wanted to know if you guys are going to let us see her grow up period💁🏽💁🏽I know she died as a baby in the comics. I hope I don't get on your nerves with my questions?
False,0,"Judith is going to die and they are trying to keep it as close to her death in the comics. But she is going to die, I can't say when though. "
False,0,That depends on what age you are referring to as grown up.
False,0,Could you tell us who is ricks next love interest after Jessie?
False,0," They better show who their lucilling as if they don't, a lot of the emotional aspects of that scene would be absolutely ruined. I personally think the season wil end with Negan saying ""ta ta"" and he leaves the group with Daryl/Glenn body."
False,0,"Negan isnt supposed to appear till later on of the second part of the season so yes, the chances it is going to be on a cliffhanger are high. There will be minor character deaths though along the way."
False,1,Tell us a Spoiler we don't know or couldn't just read about!! Please!! 
False,0,Could you see anything about perhaps the hilltop? And will we find out who Negan is lucilling or will it be a cliffhanger and we won't find out till season 7?
False,0,Ok good to know 👍🏻
False,0,"Denise will be seen alive again. She will go back to the group. 
"
False,0,*sorry that question was all messed up! But you get what I mean!!
False,0,So will Denise live to patch so she can patch up Carl?
False,0,He kills Dwight and takes it back 😂
False,0,"Maxile why do you think Sasha can't fight? You look a lot like Rick, did you know that?"
False,0,Maggie
False,0,"Nope maggi kill maggi true survive.
But maggi have a childred .
Maggi know fight , and shara  don't know fight whitout

False,0,No offence but Sasha looks as if she could rip Maggie's head off with her bare hands. 
False,1,Maggie
False,0,No weapons.. Sasha
False,0,Morgan peace vs Hershel peace
False,0,Sasha.

False,0,I can't  wait  for  tonight 
False,0,Me too. The season went so fast. 
False,0,I'm a very impatient person!! But this will give me time to read the rest of the comics so I'm caught up. 
False,0,Plus the new issue comes out wednesday!
False,0,I like that they break the show up into two half seasons. The time always goes by fast anyway. I'm an episode behind on badlands so I have plenty to watch.
False,0,That helps 👍🏻 who are the chicks that snuck thru that secret book case door then?

False,0,This video it can be anything.  
False,0,Someone else gave me that theory and it sounds like it could be possible. 
False,0,Hmmmmm
False,0,I'm sticking with that plan. Lol. Where else will they go with Glen? Think Daryl will kill Dwight and take over for him. Maybe!! 
False,0,That's also true.
False,0,I think they are making us believe he's safe so when they do kill him it will be more dramatic!! 
False,0,Yeah sorry to say I believe they will keep Glenn alive being that they kept playing with his death. I think you'll be a knock off the killing him now
False,0,I don't think it's Daryl. Why can't it be Glen??! He's has to live now cause they saved him before? I think there's a chance Glen might still go. 
False,0,You know its really being said that it can be Daryl but I really think it's Abraham
False,0,Ricks
False,0,"Daryl, Abe, & Sasha"
False,0,Walkers

False,0,"COMIC SPOILERS



yeah that would have been awesome if they showed how it happened, and it would have been cool if they showed his son turn. Cause in the comic Morgan ends up keeping him chained in his house. Then when Rick comes back to town Morgan leaves with him to go back to the prison. But before he leaves he tells Rick he is going to kill Dwayne, a gunshot goes off and they leave, then a frame later it shows Dwayne wander out of the house with a shot off chain. He never had the heart to do it, just like his wife in the show."
False,0,I don't like Morgan at all now! 
False,0,"Ooooooo that's what you mean(duh Della) yes it would've been cool and sad at the same time to see his mother eat him, and Morgan loose his mind😳😳🔫🔫and finally kill his wife along with killing his son before He turned🙈🙈"
False,0,"True , would've been cool to see tho"
False,0,When Rick meet up with Morgan that time I think it was in season 3. Morgan told Rick how his son  died so I guess the producers figured that that was enough💁🏽💁🏽💁🏽💁🏽

False,0,"There are a few different ways at looking at it. 

The way I look at it is that the cookie represented Alexandria and the ants surrounding the cookie represented the walkers. The ants walking down the wall represented the saviours heading to Alexandria to take everything they have and take it back to negan. ""Because everything you own now belongs to negan"". 

But. 

Each and every theory mentioned on this discussion feed makes sense. "
False,0,"that could be what it was showing, like the walkers hear him calling his mum and they all attack him i think if it happens like that then his mum will have to leave him to save the whole group, or maybe the ants on the cookie represent the cookie being alexandra and the ants being the walkers overtaking "

False,0,Right?! Lmao 😂 
False,0,I'd probably take my chances with negan too. 
False,0,Thinking I would take my chances as one of Negan's Bitches 😂😂 
False,0,Omg that was bad when he burned the guy face with an iron😱😱😱😱 I think it would be the governor for me👍🏼
False,0,How do you know 😫 I hope they don't do Daryl like that!! I would rather Glenn go! Which I really hate to say!! 
False,0,It's one of the two theories I have mentioned. I'm just unsure which one. 
False,0,Daryl will absolutely get Glenn's comic death without question
False,0,"I never would have thought of that, but your right he might replace Dwight. Especially now he stole his Cross Bow!! He's not happy about that!! "
False,0,And yeah danadro your right. He seemed a lot tougher. That's why I think it's a possibility that daryl will take his place. 
False,0,"Dmariel69 you know when Dwight becomes a ""good guy"" in the comics and becomes the leader of the saviours group. Do you not think there is s chance at all daryl could become the leader? "
False,0,"Thats a tough question!! I'm torn too.. Part of me thinks his Character has been lacking lately and they might kill him off. But they could also pick it back up and have him running shit. I don't like the Dwight they picked for the show. The comic book Character seemed tougher or something, right? "
False,0,Hell no Darryl will not become part of Negan's group👎🏼👎🏼and I think Abraham is going to die like Glenn did in the comic😊✊🏽
False,0,Carol

False,0,"It's a tough one but I would have to go with michonne 

Carol is a hard nut but michonne really knows how to use that samurai sword of hers. "
False,0,"Yeah I understand what you mean. Negan is bigger stronger and more intimidating but he is not an absolute nut case like the governor. 

In all fairness. They are both as bad as each other. "
False,0,Negan
False,0,Sorry but negan makes the governor look about as intimidating as Eugene. 
False,0,"The governor. 

Negan is a horrible person but he also has feeling and an understanding to what's happening and what he's doing for his community and the world. However the governor was a sociopath and he didn't care about what he did to people as long as he was alive and won the fight. "
False,0,You think? Governor was pretty ruthless to remember he had human heads in the tank other than the Walker heads in with throw you into a walker pit look what he did to the people at work very when they went to fight back he killed them all
False,0,Negan💁🏽
False,0,"From everything I've read, his worse than the Governor,  smarter and more ruthless and controlling. Though, people seem to prefer him as the bad guy. "
False,0,Dmariel69 is right. He is the new enemy of the Alexandrians. He is one ruthless guy but I would he say he is as bad as the governor. He is definitely up there though. 
False,0,"Gm he's the new bad guy, and according to the comic book he's worse then the governor. He also kills with no remorse. So there you go he's the new bad guy👌👌"

False,0,Ya its called the last of us very similar to the walking dead there trying to get ellie who been bite but is immune to some scintist so they can cure it and walk across america to get there and joel was payed to take her

False,0,Rickkk
False,0,"Rick. 

All life is precious to Morgan. He wouldn't have the bottle to take Rick down. 

Rick will take anyone on to survive (or to ensure the safety of his family.)"
False,0,Idk💁🏽the skills that Morgan has developed I think Rick is going to have to just give Morgan a head shot from the start🔫🔫🔫🔫
False,0,Stick Morgan and rick's machete hehehe 
False,0,Hand to hand ? Morgan. Wits? Rick.
False,0,The W guy Morgan was hiding knocked Morgan out and took Dr. Beth.  Do you think he's going to protect her or use her as a human shield?
False,0,Who did die cos of him? I know he killed several people earlier and Eastman took a bite for him but no one from main cast died yet cos of him.
False,0,Morgan cost some people their lives.I think morgan and rick will go at it and he will leave morgan laying on the ground.
False,0,"I like that M. has stuck to his principles.  He's trying to redeem for his previous madness. Even if it costs him his life, he'll die honest to himself.  What kind of life is it anyway, when you have to watch your w every step,  see your loved  die. If they won't have nightmares till death they'll have to watch those fuc%=÷ up creatures till then. Hell. "
False,0,Uhmm no comment for this time but the stories begin with mess ends with mess lol 
False,1,Yes I agree Morgan do need to go😡😡I must admit at first I thought Morgan being back with the group was going to be a plus💆🏽💆🏽😉😉but now I just feel as though he just makes a mess of things💁🏽💁🏽I'm no longer team morgan👌👌👎🏼👎🏼
False,0,"Agreed, they are not leaving Alexandria. Morgan is definitely gone soon, his decisions are putting people at risk and his mindset is too different from Ricks. Gotta say though I do love his character."
False,0,Don't be surprised Morgan gets bite
False,0,"Ok I was just thinking of a safe place were the group could go for awhile. Clearly Alexandria looks like it's a lost cause, but ok I'm praying for a safe clearance of alexandria🙏🏽🙏🏽💆🏽💆🏽😊😊"

False,0,😂😂😂😂😂 sorry I might tell you spoilers when it gets closer to the time but for Now its probably best if you just wait. 
False,0,Negan might save Alexandria and demand tribute for it. Negan rhymes with Vegan. 
False,0,Kill Daryl off campaign is on.

False,0,True that! 💪💪

False,0,"Not Sasha.  She's Sexy,  fierce and can kick ass. She should more often kick ass in bikini."
False,0,man that was hard to say
False,0,I'm gonna have to say Sasha
False,0,I love Daryl but I think his Character has played its course. I would hate to see him go but Abraham needs to stay instead!! 
False,0,"I would prefer that Daryl went, but given Abrahams big speech on how he plans to live for a while I think it will be him. I don't think Kirkman will have Dwight kill him since that's how it happened in the comic. Even though that would be awesome, I say Lucille is going to suck him dry."
False,0,"Abraham should survive, He is the only tank left and my favorite. He has become the first character of our group that embraces this world"
False,0,Shouldn't Dwight kill Abraham? 
False,0,Gm I agree Abraham 👍🏼
False,0,My guess is Abraham.

False,0,Happy new year 
False,0,"Shame about Jessie . Do you think  Rick managed to get some sweet, sweaty lovin'? She looks a lot like my friend's missus.  Once, when my friend wasn't around, she said I could have her but I turned her down. Never said anything to my friend though. "
False,0,Thats exactly what I think.. Too much work for every episode. I was thinking Ron was gonna do it right before the wall went down. Maybe the Wolf will shoot him trying to get away? He did have a gun right? i think Denise might go down too. It all depends on Carls Eye if they save her 😂 
False,0,"Yeah they could but I think it would be a big hassle if they had to do the makeup for his eye every shot he is in, plus Deanna is dead and it looks like Denise is walker food so who would shoot him and then who would patch him up. I hope Denise doesn't die but it is looking that way."
False,0,"The hook kicks ass!!! Lol. But you're  right don't think they would do that now. Im still not convinced they will make Carl lose his eye! How are they gonna pull it off? Makeup? They make the Walkers look great so They could make it work, "
False,0,"I don't think they will cut off Ricks hand since they have not done it already, I honestly don't think they should have done it in the comic either. Though it does make him infinitely more badass, especially with his hook attachment since the time jump."
False,0,I wasn't sure if you meant her Hand or his Arm!! Think Ricks Arm is safe on the show? Maybe?!! 
False,0,I've never heard of anyone's arm getting chopped off😳😳😳😳
False,0,You noticed you have not seen Rick's hatchet all season till he broke the door open to get to Carl and Ron. CHOP.
False,0,"Yeah, Jessie's arm is gone for sure."
False,0,Rick's wont! 
False,0,Ok thank God cuz I would have cried if he did
False,0,No he didn't in the last episode 
False,0,"Also with snoop, she was pretty fresh so it's understandable. Maybe that bitch who just killed herself this season."
False,0,With you Snoop man
False,0,Its sofia

False,0,Tara and Rosita👍🏼👍🏼
False,0,They are gone tyreese and noah
False,0,Agreed 
False,0,"It seems like he is running the same course as he did  before Negan arrived in the comic. Rick thinks he is the boss, and gets cocky about how strong he and his people are. That attitude ultimately led to Glenns death, which brought him back down a notch."
False,0,Doesn't change the fact he became an asshole. 
False,0,"Rick is awesome, he has only become the person he needs to. Daryl I would not mind being gone, but they will never kill off rick. I BELIEVE IN RICK GRIMES!"

False,0,Yes I did to😊but it was a must see until the walking dead came on😊
False,0,Its brilliant but I prefer the walking dead obviously☺😂
False,0,By the way.  How stupid is it. Wolf has knife to her throat.  2 guns aimed at him. Not so long ago one of them was scoring headshots with 100% accuracy.  ...and they gave the guns away. One clean shot and there would've been W. on his forehead.  Oh well. 
False,0,I agree with driftwood. She is walker food.
False,0,"My modest opinion : Wolf will die but will save someone in the process.  He won't sacrifice himself,  no no. His death though will open window of opportunity for saving someone.

False,0,"Magna isn't bad news, truth be told they have not done much with her character yet but I feel like Kirkman didn't bring her into the comic for no reason. Issue 149 comes out on the ninth, some crazy shit us going on so maybe she will have more importance after the 150th issue."
False,0,don't even trip
False,0,Thanks Snoop 😊 
False,0,welcome to the app
False,0,Thanks for the welcome Thewalkingdead11 😊😊
False,0,Hahaha.. Hope you meant you weren't trying to offend me?! Lol.  
False,0,Welcome new girl ☺☺☺
False,0,look I'm tryin to offend you but you do kinda look like her
False,0,I mean you kinda look like here
False,0,It's alright 
False,0,Sry I meant better
False,0,Better is what you find better I'm guessing. 
False,0,Well we know two weapons are better but the dude asking what is the better of two lol
False,0,Lol your sounds good even better 
False,0,It's cool😂
False,0,"Wrong post
"
False,0,"Apologies. I should said Hello! at least when I've joined this community.  So.... Hello. I'm MadaFaka2k and I like pancakes.  ;) 
"
False,0,I agree with all but I got to go with Morgan's stick
False,0,I agree both are good💆🏽
False,0,Ok. I get it. So if they are able to survive few more years they might have some king of peaceful existence  as majority of walkers will vanish. Easier said than done though. 
False,0,The longer the walker has been infected the more decomposed it becomes. So the ones who have been walkers for the longest are more decomposed then those of the shortest. 
False,0,"Will they decompose to degree they are no more be able to have motoring skills? How long would that take? 
"
False,0,Yes
False,0,Yes they do 👍🏼some are more decomposed than others.
False,0,That's totally what I was thinking in one of the episodes I saw one that was really decomposed . 
False,0,"Daryl just did to Dwight, did he not? "
False,0,Darell wont give up his cross bow
False,0,"Rather see them taken to Negan and be creative with the RPG they later take back and at least blow a hole in their society, This must be next level warfare. When the Governor attacked ruthless everyone was scared and not yet ready to bite off troaths, Let's see how that goes since I love the confindence of Rick not being impressed by the slaughter party of the termites"
False,0,"I true believe they're going to do some damage🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫and make it back just in time to help save the day at Alexandria. Either lead some walkers away or kill a lot of the walkers, and make a way for Rick or someone to get to the armory. Go Rick and the team💆🏽💆🏽"
False,0,They won't give up without a fight. And they are bloody good fighters.  
False,0,I believe in them
False,0,I think they are going to kill everyone except the leader and send him back to Negan and tell him to go fuck himself. Then go save the day.
False,0,How they gonna help when they are about to give up everything they have? And they are still like 10 or 15 miles away come on man this series is abt to get crazy
False,0,"Ok, my dreams are alive again💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽😂😂😂😂💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽"
False,0,They can still save the day ☺ the gang isnt out of Alexandria yet ☺☺
False,0,They are gonna save her by being a bad ass 
False,1,Ctfu 😂😂😂😂yeah😂😂
False,0,probably with a flare gun to draw them away or use Ron as bate
False,0,"MY POST CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS



5 is the best season of the walking dead for me. 6 is pretty good, and the number of walkers has been astronomical so that's awesome. But 5 is when everyone got back together and went through that epic escape from terminus. It just set the tone for the whole season with the opening scene of everyone lined up on those sinks. And Rick really comes into his role as a wild man in the end of season 4 when he tears up those dudes Daryl was rolling with. I also enjoyed the Beth episodes even though I wasn't a big fan of Beth. Noah comes into the picture, he was awesome while he lasted. It was just awesome."
False,0,I like season 6 too
False,0,"Season 6😉it started with a lot of walkers a lot of excitement👍🏼 After watching fear of the walking dead with their slow start with an abundant amount of walkers. I was ready to continue seeing a lot of walkers anyway, and with the start of the walking dead  season 6 gave me my walker fix💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽 I'm happy😀😀😀😀"

False,0,Tyresse death took like 10 minutes and showed the hallucinations of bob and beth i nearly cried when they had his funeral and when rick put his hat on the cross

False,0,And as I've read from the comic he's vicious 
False,0,Negan was Ina prologue 
False,0,Yes he is the new threat
False,0,"I never heard yet about negan but he is a hot topic now,what is all about negan is he the threat of rick's group?"
False,0,Sup dude 
False,0,Negan I can't wait to see
False,0,That man 7s simply named as Savior 1 in credits and is played by Christopher Berry.
False,0,"It wasn't Negan, that was his saviours, basically his men."
False,0,You will hear negan before you see him with the potty mouth he has on him. That was not negan. He will be introduced the second half of the season. That was however the saviours. Negans group of survivors. 
False,0,"Jeffrey Dean Morgan will always be Denny to me. I told my wife when he was first announced, ""Denny is going to be playing Negan!!!""😱"
False,0,No. That wasn't Negan. That was his group. Well. Some of them anyway. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays Negan.
False,0,I remember Jeffrey dean good  choice he looks a lot like the comic book Negan 👍🏼👍🏼Boy o boy it's going to be hard for the ladies to dislike him😳😳he's a looker😉😉 
False,0,"Ok, well I don't want to see Negan because the guy speaking was super scary😔😔Rick is going to have to go into his crazy again💆🏽💆🏽bite a neck😂😂 ( by any means necessary to protect the group)"

False,0,"That wasn't negan.

False,0,Ok😊I'm gonna look him up right now😉

False,0,PREACH

False,0,"Wolf will die in spectacular manner and save someone with his death.

False,0,Sorry you didn't like it But it will get better 
False,0,Dude chill it'll get better
False,0,I hate Shane!!!!!
False,0,Well Rick would walk into Shane and dale fighting with t dog trying to break it up 😂😂because Shane and dale didn't get along at all 💁🏽
False,0,Rick would go crazy probably and yell at them were lori and probably get another fake call from her
False,0,Ok 
False,0,👌💆🏽😊
False,0,I like the Chicago series ( Chicago pd Chicago med Chicago Fire)
False,0,Great TV show choices and yah I think I'll give American horror story a go ☺☺
False,0,Game of Thrones
False,0,Dexter I  lost interest I don't know why😔😔
False,0,Game of thrones  is one of my favorites( I heard that John snow will be resurrected😳😳💆🏽💆🏽)Mr white breaking bad loved it. Jessie James haven't watch. American horror story is good session 1 and season 4 (with the witches ) are the best to me. Please let me know what you think👌
False,0,"I did also watch dexter, breaking bad and revenge when they were still airing. Those shows were amazing. I think I will give American horror story a try. "
False,0,"I watch game of thrones,  outlander, into the badlands and Jessica Jones ☺☺"
False,0,yo Mac In To The Badlands is my shit
False,0,And modern family
False,0,Season 6 hasn't finished yet 
False,0,"look if I was Carl I would of said ""your dad is an asshole like you, u-bitch-u."""
False,0,Your dad is asshole 
False,0,It's true anyways 😂
False,0,😂😂lol somebody had to do it😳😳😂😂
False,0,I've never been to college I dropped out outta high school when I was a teenager
False,0,Yup I am snoop im first year college so need to pursue 
False,0,you still in college?
False,0,Well dont have time to watch cuz I'm busy at my study
False,0,Lol actually Im not yet watching the last mid ep so I dont know
False,0,"Carl and Ron started fighting, drew all the walkers to Jessie's house were they where😳😳😳😳the house got run over, so they killed 2 walkers but walker blood over them(to distract the walkers) Deanna was already bit and dying so they left her behind in one of Jessie's bedrooms. Deanna opened the door walkers was coming down the hall, and she just started firing her gun 3 head shots straight she did until she was out of bullets. Then she screamed at the walkers, but you know she was getting ate up not much longer after she ran out of bullets."
False,0,"She feel on a saw and she also got bit by a walker. Now Rick, machone, father Gabriel, carl, ron, and Sam was tramped in Jessie's house, and Judith was in the house with them too"
False,0,Deanna died already😳braise yourself girl she's gone yup 
False,0,Deanna it's weird maybe she is going to die I think 
False,0,"And I was blah about Deanna, but she went out like a solder."
False,0,oh yeah
False,0,"Lol it's not the fact that he ""killed the elderly"" are we all forgetting that he was a wife beater and possibly child beater as well "
False,0,Yea
False,0,that's some fucked up shit
False,0,he's dad was an ass hole he killed an elderly
False,0,But your dad was an ASS WHOLE😂😂😂😂😂😘
False,0,Yeah I totally think Sam and Jessie maybe Ron will die in the next episode 
False,0,"""Your dad is asshole""
                 Carl Grimes 2015"
False,0,Hmmmmm
False,0,Carl will lose his eye.......
False,0,"Probably not because the leader of Alexandria in the comics (Douglas) shoots Carl by accident in the comics and Deanna died in last night's episode, so it is unlikely he will get shot, but I do have a strong feeling Sam and possibly Jessie will die."
False,0,Negan is the next governor basically 
False,0,I ain't scared of no negan
False,0,If you think this episode was crazy wait to you see episode 9.......
False,0,"He covers his teams weapons in walker blood so if they cut you, you are infected."
False,0,Pretty much.
False,0,"wait slow down so negan is a combination of the governor, the wolves, shane, and the terminus people? all in one person"
False,1,Negan is the main antagonist in the whole comic book series. He kills Glenn in the comics and is the leader of the saviours. He carry's a bat covered in barbed wire called lucille.
False,1,"He's a better villain than the Governor, can't wait to see him in the show!"
False,1,He is the best enemy the walking dead has ever seen. Can't wait till the next issue!
False,2,well that's a dick move
False,0,I think his savours will kill Abraham 
False,0,I think he's going to kill Abraham 💁🏽I really do
False,0,He may kill someone else
False,0,So glad they're obviously going to get reunited 
False,0,My first thought was call out to her😊😊let her know you're coming for her💆🏽💆🏽
False,0,Yes only sprite ;)
False,0,Only Sprite?
False,0,I love to dink Sprite :)
False,0,Definitely agree. Waking dead and drinking sound awesome.
False,0,"She was quite a key side character to be fair, probably just setting us up for some crazy main character deaths "
False,0,"Me neither, but she went out with a bang🔫🔫🔫🔫💆🏽💆🏽go Deanna 👊🏽👊🏽😉😉"
False,0,Least it wasn't a main character 😂
False,0,I don't really like her but😢
False,0,I post spoilers but i never said that his eye was coming out tonight.......
False,0,My profile picture of Negan is better.
False,0,They went out of the way and gave Rick his machete and Carl his hat because when jesse and Ron die Rick uses his machete and Carl wears his hat. I hope that they aren't screwing with you
False,0,To each is own💁🏽💁🏽💁🏽💁🏽and I don't think that the producers are messing with us😳they're not doing anything different from what other producers do with any other shows. It's really not that deep😳😳😳😳
False,0,I think that he's going to get himself and his mom killed in the next episode
False,0,when I heard that I thought about that family guy episode where stewie is saying mom mom mom mom mommy mommy mommy mommy mama mama mama 
False,0,Sam is beast mom mom
False,0,"Yea he is ""mom mom""  Hello can't you shut up Sam "
False,1,His ass is going to get ate to the bone
False,0,He killed Her? 
False,0,Noooooo
False,0,"I thought the ending was pretty good for mid season. Denise is walker food, I think the wolf will use her to distract the walkers while he gets away. Or maybe Denise will step up to the plate and turn the tables. Just hearing Negan's name was enough of a good ending for me. "
False,0,I saw it on YouTube IM SIKED
False,0,Repeat 12@m
False,0,I did not see it will u find a link for YouTube for me
False,0,"Heck yeah,  we finally get to see Negan "
False,0,True ... True.. Did u see after when tha opening of badlands came on tho
False,0,"Negan didn't cut off Ricks hand, the governor did pretty early in the comic. But get ready to meet a real enemy, Negan makes the governor look like a pussy. Say goodbye to Jessie, Rom, and Sam though. Maybe Ron will live, but given his position in line, I'd say no."
False,0,Negan does make a big change in the group personnel by who he kills off 
False,0,"When I think bout it Abraham might get taken out being that his braveness nd boldness could get him killed standing up to negan. Rick losing an hand hmmm not sure maybe an finger or two. Carl grazed in tha eye prolly, remember like when Daryl got picked off by Andrea when she thought he was an walker"
False,0,"How close to the comic storyline do you think  they are gonna stay?  In the comics Negan kills Glen with Lucille, cuts Rick's hand off and Carl gets shot in the head and loses an eye"
False,0,I wish I could agree wit that.. Kinda worried
False,0,😳😳😳😳😔😔😔😔 they're going to handle it👍🏼👍🏼😉😉I believe in them👍🏼👍🏼💆🏽💆🏽
False,0,Omg😱😱😱😂😂😂😂
False,0,"Yeah I think one of the saviours will kill Abraham, likely to be Dwight"
False,0,Negan will kill daryl
False,0,Really😱😱I didn't know that😳😳
False,0,"Dwight does, not Negan."
False,0,I was wrong they couldn't have fought all those zombies. I just wanted them to be quiet😤😤shhhhhhhh
False,0,Yeah Sam is going to cause jessie and rons death because in the mid season finale he was talking while they were amongst the zombies.😱😱 
False,0,No Negan is here in the comics he killed glenn
False,0,Carl was supposed to lose an eye in this episode 
False,0,True
False,0,"True prolly gonna wind up goin bak to negan, nd he gonna slap him up a bit"
False,0,And they had the same wife
False,0,Look at Dwight tv character in the search
False,0,That is true but he gets the burnt face after we met him and they already introduced him
False,0,"Dwight is supposed to have a burnt face caused by Negan,  and in the comics he has a lot of similar characteristics to the TV Daryl..."
False,0,We already saw Dwight though he was the one that stole daryls bike
False,0,And with this crossbow he'll kill someone. 
False,0,Dwight is the one that stole his bike and crossbow
False,0,Look at Dwight tv character in the search
False,0,"Could be,  I didn't hear his name"
False,0,But Dwight was the one that stole daryls bike they said his name
False,0,I don't think Dwight himself will actually show up.  I think Daryl is his TV counterpart and after the war with Negan and the saviors Daryl will take Dwight's place as leader of the saviors
False,0,No I think it's gonna be different and do u think that Dwight is already part of the group
False,0,Think Negan's group will be call the saviors
False,0,I truly think that the wolf guy likes her👍🏼👍🏼I don't think he's going to hurt her. They may run back inside after seeing all those walkers that's out there😱😱
False,0,"He would most likely keep her alive because she nurse him bak to health she's useful in his eyes, least that's the way I seee it"
False,0,"So did , so did i"
False,0,some guy named negan shows up
False,0,Megan's group did not have any w's on their head
False,0,"Yes it is, I swear Carol knows when nd where nd how to play wit ur head"
False,0,"Morgan should have just stayed psychotic, his all life is precious is gonna end up losing a lot of lives"
False,0,I'm sooooo cursing Morgan out in my head right now😡😡😡😡😡
False,0,Omg 😱😱😱 you guys just don't know I'm freaking out with anticipation to get home and watch😳😳😳😳
False,0,Ooooo shit well there goes Tara's women💁🏽💁🏽and it's good to know they're still there💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽I can't wait to get home. Thank you👌👌👍🏼😘
False,0,"Negan's cohorts finally showed themselves so expect to see him next half season, also they had no W on their foreheads so wonder who the wolves are affiliated with. The main group are sneaking thru the horde trying to get away and Jesse's son is starting to whig out,  Glen and Enid see Maggie stranded by herself on a catwalk along the wall."
False,0,And our fellow colleagues are in trouble... 
False,0,"Carl nd Ron had a little fight , say this much if u watch closely they sold it well when they said Carl's eye could get shot.. But nah. Almost thought.. Nd Deanna died"

False,0,Spencer MIA

False,0,"With Aaron not shown,  he'll probably be the one with Glen and Enid to collect everyone to a safe place"

False,0,I don't ?
False,0,9 o clock
False,0,In the comics Negan is the leader of the saviors. He and his group receive payment from Hilltop and The Kingdom for providing protection from the walkers 
False,0,"Who are the wolves supposed to be?
Ezekiel and the Kingdom? 
Dwight and the Hilltop community?

False,0,Wow this whole time I thought that the governor keep his daughter locked up. Thanks for the clarity 👍🏼😊
False,0,"Negan and Rick are similar in ways. By hey both believe what they are doing for their community is he right thing. Negans way is just a little more abusive than ricks way of leading (and that's saying something). 

The governor on the other hand was a phsycho and sociopath with a severe split personality (eg. Taking his dead brothers identity and keeping his niece locked away as a ""biter"".)

I think that if this was to happen (which it obviously won't, but theoretically speaking) negan and Rick would team up against the loon.   "
False,0,He would be Negan's  bitch😉😉we still would just have to worry about Negan and that's it💁🏽💁🏽
False,0,Ok😊I keep forgetting that carol committed suicide in the book and Sophia is till alive.how sweet you put that (adolescent apocalyptic way) awwwwwww🌹🌻🌼🌺😍👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨💜💛💚💙💝👫
False,0,Yes exactly. That child was Carol's daughter. Obviously Carol has been gone for a long time in the comic and in the show her daughter has been gone for a long time so this wouldn't work. Enid fits the age and bill of the part. Carl is even remotely involved in the comic with Sophie for awhile in an adolescent post apocalyptic way
False,0,In the comic Maggie and Glenn adopt a child😊👌are you saying Enid is going to be their adopted child?
False,0,Agreed
False,0,At'll happen! The show must go on.
False,0,It's ok to each is own😉😉

False,0,"Mid season finale. 

The walkers break into Alexandria. Alexandrians are scared and trying to protect themselves but relying on the skill of ricks survivors to save them. Morgan will die whilst saving Alexandrians. Ricks new lover lover woman will die and her son Sam  because Rick won't save her because Rick looks after his ""family"" and she isn't family. Carl will get his eye shot out by Ron but survive. Ron will die. Abraham daryl sasha Glenn and Enid get back through the broken wall and help dispose of the roaming corpses. Obviously a lot more deaths of Alexandrians but I don't believe any other main characters will die. 

I have a feeling they will introduce a new character at the end called Jesus who will help develop the story of negan in the second half of the series. 


The finale. 

To cut a long story short. Daryl will meet ""Lucille"" and he have a courageous and emotional ending. "
False,0,The Wall falling Will give The Wolf a chance to badly wound Morgan so he'll pay for his stupidity!
False,0,"Ron will shoot Carl, he will survive and its just a graze....I don't think it will be his whole eye though like in the comics.  But the Jessie part will be exactly the same maybe not Sam though, I feel like Sam will be orphaned and carol will be his adoptive mom....not sure of Judith's fate, I think it will throw Rick over the edge for her to die now....Abe, Sasha, and Daryl will meet up with glen and Enid and will either use patty (the fuel truck) or the rockets to save the day.  Glen and Maggie will reunite and adopt Enid as theirs.  The only thing I don't really know how the alpha wolf prisoner things gonna play out??"
False,0,***Of course Carol not sharon!  My bad
False,0,"Sam Will go banans! Sweet mama Sharon messed him up with her ""you must kill or you Will become a monster!"" 
Every Child she gets near loses it or die! "
False,0,"Daryl Sasha Abraham will drive patty that's the truck name. Will brun the walkers
"
False,0,Yeah. And now Maggie will die! Yay! 
False,0,GLENN FOR PRESIDENT! 
False,0,the second coming of Glenn
False,0,Lol yes I enjoy watching that Glenn was alive😊😊😉😉💆🏽💆🏽
False,0,No...she is just in survival mode and for her that is just easiest to do alone
False,0,"No,then why would she help glenn"
False,0,I guess she isn't. She just has suffered a lot. 
False,0,she is 
False,0,No. Just confused but I don't trust her.
False,0,Who knows 🙍🏽but Ron has to go🙅🏽🙅🏽😡😡
False,0,Rather rick with michonne Than rick and Carol! !!!!!!
False,0,"Yeah its from the truck. Rick just wants to be a dad to Ron since he killed his dad. I really don't see what Rick sees in Jessie anyway, other than her being the best looking woman on the show. If you ask me Rick and Carol should get together. They understand each other well."
False,0,"The tower fell because wood was falling off of it, and it collapsed. Probably due to the truck hitting it, and damaging it severely.  "
False,1,To much stress o on it with all the walkers and want in good shape. 
False,0,He has been seen with the eye patch but due to TWDs treatment with Glenn dying I kinda wonder if it has been done just to throw all the comic readers off??  Also love the idea of Ron missing and Carl shooting him in the eye...that would be awesome
False,0,Read someplace that Carl has been seen on set with a bandage over his eye??? 
False,0,"Great prediction, definitely a possibility"

False,0,You know what she's just Afraid 😔😔😔but she better get it together!!!
False,0,Yeah and Maggie is pregnant 😰😦😲 so The show must Milk her pragnantse much more before she Will die! 😬😳
False,0,"Really doubt it will be Maggie, too important in the comics...but ya never know......"
False,0,Maggie won't die right now she is one of the safest characters
False,0,Maybe ricks new lover...
False,0,Probably Deanna because but not like how her counterpart in the comics maybe she gets bitten then dies peacefully
False,0,My money's still on Eugene. 
False,0,I think it's going to be Maggie to because it looked like she wasn't making it up the ladder fast enough so yes Maggie 
False,0,I got my grandson with me
False,1,Enjoy your holiday👌👌from your old head 😉👍🏼😊Dmariel69😊
False,0,"I think it will be daryl. They will not bring Glenn back into the series to kill him off again. It wouldn't make any sense at all. Daryl would be the best choice and the interest between him and carol could see carol having a similar reaction to maggie in the comic series. 

Plus Daryl's character has become Weaker in my opinion in recent episodes and seems to be a piece of eye candy for the lady fans so I don't think he would be a great loss to the programme. 

The character Jesus will be in the programme soon who will take a similar role to daryl anyway (ricks right hand hard man). So it would make sense to kill him off. 

This is just my opinion though. I have no proof what so ever that this will happen. "
False,0,"I honestly don't know...its down to (keeping it true) Glenn, (keeping it extremely powerful) Daryl, (safest choice to not piss off too many fans) Morgan or (going all the way different) Carol.....  Damn it why can't they wait another decade to introduce Negan???"
False,0,None of the main actors won't died
False,0,Eugene
False,0,Daryl or Morgan I'm sorry it is just gotta happen I mean not Glenn they brought him back for a reason so
False,0,Lmaoo someone said Ron 😂im dead
False,0,Or abraham
False,0,"Glenn, in front of maggie"
False,0,It might be Ron or Morgan 
False,0,"Not glen they already did to much to him, Morgan will not allow that we already seen his journey, so either Abraham or Aaron."
False,0,Team glenn ftw!

False,0,Yes the governor 💁🏽💁🏽he had 2 faces 😉😉
False,0,True snoop

False,0,Yes it is short😡😡every time I be like damn that's it😳😳😳😳well the man locked in the bathroom finally became a walker😳😳😳😳it's gonna be a mess on that plane 😔😔😔
False,0,"It's good, isn't everything walking dead good though??  But it's too short each time"
False,0,You should star checking it out it's good I think so anyway 
False,0,I dont
False,0,Possibility she Is out there 😳and she has to realize by now that it's more zombies around than usual so I could Amazon her needing help as well😊
False,0,If merle was still alive then he would be wondering on his own. He was a loose cannon and didn't like taking orders. Plus he had the older brother hold on daryl so there wouldn't be daryl in the tv series. 
False,0,Well Merle would have died before Alexandrian😒because he was such a loose cannon like Shane had become 💁🏽💁🏽Glenn would've killed him for sure🔫🔪Glenn's beef with him was deep👌👌remember that they fault at the prison (I could be wrong but I don't think he would have made it to Alexandria💁🏽)
False,0, He would have left and worked for himself like he said on the talking dead
False,0,he'd probably would of killed every one in Alexandra
False,0,"It wasn't Glenn

False,0,I think it is Glenn but you never know
False,0,I do ☺
False,0,the leader

False,0,I think Carol might meet Lucile. 
False,0,Morgan or Daryl
False,0,Actually I believe that
False,0,Then Carl get his eye shot out 
False,0,Wow 👌
False,0,The walkers will get through the walls and kill Jesse and Sam. Rick won't blink an eye lid at it. 
False,0,It could be Jessie and Sam he kills. That would make it even more personal between him and Rick😉😉just a thought😊
False,0,Maybe 
False,0,That could actually be a good theory... 
False,0,he better not
False,0,Nobody is safe. That's the idea to the series. 
False,0,"Carol.... it is carol 
... last to go .
. For the last season"
False,0,Rick Daryl Carl maggie
False,0,Oh and Judith 
False,0,Rick and Carl and Carol everyone else is free game yes even Daryl 
False,0,Ok that's good to know 😊👍🏼
False,0,They already said that anyone could do in it but they do not want to kill carol because of how much she developed. She is the safest on the show Greg nicotero said it himself 
False,0,no one safe
False,0,"Rick. Carl. Judith. 
I wanna say Carol and Daryl. But I think they could possibly die. This season, maybe not. Later, yes! "
False,0,Ok I do know of one person. Rick everyone else is pretty much open😔sad to write😏😏but yeah💁🏽

False,0,Have a good trip👋🏽👋🏽walking dead new episode tomorrow brah✊🏽✊🏽tell the fam I said hello👐🏼👐🏼and chat with you tomorrow 😊😊😊(I know we're not friends just being nice😊)

False,0,Michonne and Carol they're even love both of them
False,0,😞😀😞😀😞😀😞😀😞😀😞😀😞😀
False,0,Beth was my favorite now since she's dead :-(  now it's Maggie :-) 
False,0,Mischonne .
False,0,Hard to pick between Carol and Michonne. 
False,0,Michonne
False,0,Carol
False,0,"Maggie 
"
False,1,Carol no doubt
False,0,Then he needs to just die 🔪🔫
False,0,What if he's not infected but won't work with anyone that'd be intressting. 
False,0,Bit 
False,0,But
False,0,Lol he dead👌😊✊🏽👍🏼 Morgan better kill his ass🔪🔫I don't have a stick emoji 😳😳😳 yes Jim did start sweating a lot even more during the ride to the cdc😳😳so I can see that theory that what ever happened to him happened just hours before the attack 😉😊
False,0,he dead
False,0,"My Theory:In Here's Not Here, Alpha Wolf said he was hoping to find medicine. His first appearance was in Conquer the last episode of Season 5. If he was bit he would have turned. But he did say he was sweating,in Season 1,Jim was sweating like crazy. So possibly it was a recent wound a few hours(not days or he would have died)so it might have happened before the attack on Alexandria. "
False,0,"Deanna needs to carry around  a foot stole with her😂😂😂😂so she can get the head shots, stabbings right💁🏽(little lady)😊😊she would've been all night with the killing of that walker💁🏽💁🏽😳😳im just saying😒😒"
False,0,"I think he was bit because at the end of episode 4 season 6 Morgan was telling the guy his story right👍🏼then he let the guy speak and the wolf guy showed him a cut, bit, or slash he had on his side💁🏽and the guy said to Morgan I'm already starting to sweet😳😳😳😳so that's why I think he was bit or something😒😒I'm just not sure what the wound is from💁🏽😒"
False,0,"Why do you think he was bit? Morgan popped him in the face with his stick but that's all I can recall. I doubt he is bit, he would already be running a fever and they probably wouldn't be able to do anything with his storyline since even Deanna can take out a single walker."
False,0,I think its those two people who stole Daryl's crossbow and bike
False,0,It's Glenn
False,0,I think it's that guy that DIXON meet in the last episode aka DWIGHT
False,0,Its Glenn
False,0,"It was Glenn. In Thank You,Glenn had a backpack containing a walker talkie,knife,flare gun, and other unidentified items. So while Nicholas was being devoured(after shooting himself)he could have went underneath the dumpster or quickly jumped INSIDE the dumpster. He could have set of a flare diverting the walkers from the dumpster. So it was Glenn cause Paul Monroe(Jesus) was not introduced (yet)"
False,0,It's not Glenn. Norman Reedus already confirmed that it wasn't Glenn. I think it was Jesus aka Paul Monroe from the comics. They already casted him before the season started. 
False,0,It's not Glenn on the walkie talkie but Glenn is alive 
False,0,"Glenn might be alive? YAY I'm sooooooooo happy I hope it is Glenn
"
False,0,it's Rick 
False,0,"I think it's Rick. After they showed the breach in the wall that one episode, I assume the walkers got in. Could be Glenn, but if he is under rhat dumpster I don't think he would want to be drawing any attention to his location."

False,1,they gonna fuck
False,0,The next one
False,0,I like episode 1 season 1 because it shows how it all came together
False,0,I can see that good one👍🏼👍🏼
False,0,I think it may have to be season one episode one. The show immediately captivated me and straight away Rick was a great character. Plus the cliff hanger at the end was incredible when he was stuck in the tank and then Glenn came one the radio to him. That first episode made me want to watch all the rest and I've never looked back. 
False,0,Yeeeeees😉you said it all about the grove👍🏼👍🏼😊😊 it was great work on the directors part(Michael Satrazemis) and all the actors👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽I went threw so many emotions 1rst I was like yes they can stay there find the others and be safe for awhile💆🏽2nd anger like who in the hell is Lilly yelling at she better get that shit right and realize that walkers aren't a new kind of breaded people you can teach and keep as a pet crazy🙈🙈😡😡3rd sadness like owell it wasn't meant pack up and lets keep moving 😳😳😔😔💁🏽💁🏽but yes it was one of the good ones I watched it 2more times🙆🏽🙆🏽I loved it👍🏼😊
False,0,I have another favorite episode 💆🏽season 1 episode 4 vatos😊😉
False,0,"For me its The Grove season 4 episode 14. It captured almost everything the show is. 
Hope. When Tyreese saved by Carol. 
Past catching up. When Carol had to tell Tyreese about Karen. 
Forgiveness. When he forgave her for it. 
Boldness. When Mika was ready to kill the walkers to save them. 
Humanity. She refusing to anything unless its necessary. 
Craziness. Lizzie losing her mind. 
And my favourite themes of the show. Doing what needs to be done. And what the apocolypse does to people. 

And the acting by Mellisa and Chadman was amazing. Even the kids had done an amazing job. "
False,0,Yes I do think he is alive✊🏽
False,0,Does anyone else think that Glenn could be alive
False,0,The grove session 4 episode 14 👍🏼😊😉
False,0,"They probably will just realize that they were stupid to believe she was just a ""den mother"" of this group. "
False,0,Shes class 
False,0,O let me make this clear whom I'm writing this to👌NEGAN👀👀👀👀 I like to be straight forward not beat around the bush and hope that the person know I'm coming at them✌🏼️✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼
False,0,Lol no what is lame is you😳😳💁🏽💁🏽taking what I wrote so personal like it's real life😂😂😂😂😂Writing insults😏😏😏😏please 😏😏NOW READ THIS ITS NOT REAL😳😳😳😳😳and I'm entitled to write my opinion as I see fit👌👌👌👌💁🏽the name calling is childish you must be young😊if you got offended by what I wrote don't read my shit👌👌👌👌👌
False,0,Just so lame to think about daryl and carol hook up. I guess their relationship is like mother-son or sister-brother or just as plain as close friends . I'll be damned if we'll see them fucking. 
False,0,"Lol,  auto correct. Try again. I think it will be Eugene because they need to keep all the strong characters for the upcoming fighting with Negan, etc. "
False,0,I think it who'll be Eugene. They need to keep all the strong cheeseburgers for the upcoming fighing. 
False,0,MAGGIE CAN NEVER DIE
False,0,Maggie is pregnant. I hope they don't kill a pregnant girl. And I believe Darryl will survive till the end
False,0,It has to be Abraham and daryl out of the main characters to die (if Glenn definitely comes back-which rumours are saying he will do as he has been spotted filming). However there is a good chance deanna will die along with a few more back ground faces. 
False,0,"Yes it would be very hurtful if Darryl die😔 I would feel really really really bad for carol because that would be the 3rd big lose for her (Sophia, Mekah,and Darryl) she would just she her feelings down for any other person all together 😔 also can Darryl and Carol get together💏👫before he get killed off the show 💁🏽👌"
False,0,If Daryl dies... I'll just cry my eyes out. Daryl is too much of a fan favourite to be killed. It would be really impactful. 
False,0,No disrespect just joking 😊

"
False,0,Whoo
False,0,Ok😉👍🏼😊
False,0,Yah hopefully that part will be revealed Sunday.
False,0,Glenn did know about the pregnancy already😉👍🏼if you watch episode 1of season 6 again when Rick is asking people to go out with him to lead the walkers away Glenn and Maggie is sitting on the couch Glenn is telling Maggie to stay behind I don't think it was for her to stay and help Deanna like they made it seem😳it was because she's pregnant is the reason why he wanted her to stay behind😉but I can't wait for Sunday to get here so I can see how true this spoiler is👌👌

False,0,"Glenn should already be dead in the show anyway, the way they faked it would have been a great way for him to go out. The only redemption would be a straight from the comic death.

False,0,Glenn a smart guy
False,0,Nooo😔😔😔🙅🏽🙅🏽I'm scared for him to come🙅🏽🙅🏽🙆🏽🙆🏽in the comic he kills Glenn horribly😔😔🙈🙈I'm not ready 🙈🙈
False,0,Shane was my favorite character. 
False,0,Shane was adapting for survival. His conscience was troubled but he did what he had to do to survive. He reacted without hesitation and dealt with it later. His obsession with Lori was his downfall though. His mind was too preoccupied and clouded with jealousy. 
False,1,Shane I do miss because he was a no nonsense type of guy he was that thug I loved it. But Andrea told him in session 2 that his approach was to harsh and his love for Lorre he let consume him💁🏽he no longer wanted to rule with Rick he wanted to rule by himself and o yeah be Rick🙅🏽🙅🏽remember he told Rick that him coming back messed everything up(yeah in his world) I miss him with his fine ass😘😘😘but he had to go because he was no longer a team player bottom line💁🏽💁🏽
False,0,Shane's earlobes tho 😂
False,0,"He was one if the best characters and even though you knew he was going to have to die, it still would have been cool for him to stay a bit longer "
False,0,"He was a good character in the show, a necessary death to turn Rick into the animal he is today. Rick basically IS Sha e now"
False,0,"he killed Otis, he killed Randy, and he tried to kill Rick"
False,0,Yeah but Shane thought Rick was dead. He wouldn't have done that if he knew his best friend was alive.
False,0,well that's true Shane helped carol by kickin ed's ass but he fucked ricks wife
False,0,ctfu?
False,0,Really Ctfu 😂😂😂😂that was funny😂😂that was you dropping like its hot video good concept 😂😂
False,0,Don't believe I'm sorry 
False,0,This may seem corny😳but my husband fond believe you care enough to be on this site talking about the walking dead🙆🏽🙆🏽🙅🏽🙅🏽he thinks I'm the only one that's crazy about the show 😳😳so what can I tell him to let him know that it is uncle snoop😂😂not my uncle I'm probably older than you 💁🏽💁🏽👌if you don't reply it's cool ✌🏼️✌🏼

False,0,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
False,0,TV show. 
False,0,Thanks that's a very good point 👍
False,0,"I'll say the comics are a lot more harder on the characters. The show has toned down a lot. But I believe the show has developed characters lot more than the comics according to me. Though maybe its because I could really see the characters alive. 

Video games are totally different. They don't go so hard on the characters as the show or the comics. "
False,0,"Comics are way better, but the show has really stepped it up since season 4. "
False,0,The comics they're more graphic😳🙈but I soooooo love watching the show love it 😍😍😍😍😍😍
False,0,"Yah the comics are very good
"
False,0,"Comic

Telltale games

False,0,It's only an idea. But never the less. No problem!
False,0,Thanks Deankeary for that💆🏽👍🏼
False,0,💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽hello yaaaaaaaas💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽I can see that hello that's how Glenn is going to be saved yaaaaaas💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽I happy now
False,0,Or will he use it to save Glenn by blowing up the fuel truck?
False,0,Yes snoop he will blow a whole in the wall😁😁I just figured it's so many of them that it wouldn't make it to the wall to damage it at all 💁🏽💁🏽👀the walkers are like 20 deep all around but it is a possibility that it would make it threw no matter how deep the walkers are it is a rocket 💁🏽💁🏽👌👌just wishful thinking on my part😉😉😊😊
False,0,He will use it against the saviours. 
False,0,Oh yah 😂😂😂
False,1,if he does that he gonna blast a hole in the wall
False,0,Oh yah 😂😂
False,0,I don't think it will be any of the original cast. 
False,1,"Why is it so unrealistic if someone doesn't die? Why can't a group of people who can really handle themselves survive? 
I won't mind is someone dies. But why should someone necessarily die. 
And I think Glenn will come back, and they won't kill him now. I guess if they had to, they should have killed him in Thank You. 
They can kill off Maggie. But don't kill Carl and Judith. It would be so interesting to see Judith grow up. If someone has played The Last Of Us on PS3 and PS4 will know what I mean. Seeing the world from her point of view will be entirely different than ours. "
False,0,Those were my thoughts. We think he's dead my heart is broken 💔 they bring him back just to kill him my heart will be broken 💔 stay out my feels TWD!!
False,0,"I agree that it would be stupid to bring him back just to kill him. Perhaps pregnant Maggie instead? Someone in the main group has to die though, it's getting unrealistic."
False,0,You know what that would be stupid for the writers to do that😏but Glenn do get killed by Negan in the comic book.
False,0,I knew he wasn't dead
False,0,https://youtu.be/uH57N5oNYpw
False,0,Oh tnx but there is this video I thought he was dead let me send u de link
False,0,he's ok he just under a dumpster  he may smell but he safe
False,0,💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽yeah😊😊
False,0,He's alive and will be in episode 7
False,0,Lol Abraham better stop starting trouble 😳😳
False,0,Sashraham 
False,1,They have a fuel truck hopefully full of fuel and a rocket launcher 😳😳they're so about to do some damage 👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽to all those walkers outside of Alexandria 💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽💆🏽watch as I tell you👍🏼👍🏼
False,1,I saw that rocket launcher before he did and my eyes just opened when I saw it
False,1,Clenn😂 Glenn isnt dead hell be back 😂😂
False,0,"At first I thought it was Rick but the more I listened, it doesn't sound like Rick at all. Or anyone we ""know"" actually. "
False,0,"Norman reedus (Daryl) said it was not Glenn but that doesn't meam Glenn is dead it just means he wasn't the one the walkie talkie 
"
False,0,yeah but it's your opinion if you don't believe me
False,0,You the for really real snoop?
False,0,look on my bio
False,0,My honest thoughts were that it should've been Michonne on the fence. Then I actually said I would have rather it been Daryl. And I'm a hardcore Daryl fan. But I just love Glenn so much. 
False,0,I don't want any of them to die kill off the other people 😉😊not the main characters 👌👌
False,1,Like I said if Glenn is already dead then I'm 75% sure that daryl will have the ending Glenn does in the comic book. I think daryl is a good character but I feel like he is just there at times for eye candy for the women fans where as Glenn is a solid character. 
False,0,I don't want either of them to die. True if it wasn't for Glenn then there would be no Rick but Daryl is just such an awesome character that we've seen evolve so much through the series. But if I absolutely had to choose one or the other then it would be Glenn only because ***SPOILERS***he already died in the comic. It was shocking and heartbreaking but Rick and Maggie already buried him and the story goes on. I think the fact that I know it's coming is what will make the loss of Glenn less devastating. 
False,1,I would choose daryl to go. Glenn is a great character and also he is one of the very few characters to have not killed a human. He doesn't deserve to die. Plus if it wasn't for Glenn there would be no Rick. 
False,0,Neither 
False,0,"Neither, sorry, I like them both for different reasons and would be very upset if either was killed off unless it isat their request to do other projects then would really miss the 
character bit would wish them the best. "
False,1,Interesting 😂😂
False,0,"They both are unique in their own way, I wouldn't want to lose either of them but if I had to choose, I'd choose Glenn. "
False,1,I wouldn't want these two characters dead but there are others I wouldn't miss.
False,0,At the scene where daryl and Dwight and the gang were hinting from the saviours you could hear a radio of the saviours talking to each other. That could have been a radio Dwight was carrying because I doubt daryls radio would have picked up there signal because they would have had radio contact with these guys well before this happened. It's only an idea. But just watch that scene again and you will get what I'm saying. 
False,0,I doubt it if it was Dwight cuz daryl had the walkie talkie when they was in the truck 
False,0,I think it's one of two possibilities. It's either Dwight asking help from daryl because he has been captured by Negans men (the saviours)....or its one of the Alexandrian residents asking for help because the herd outside the wall have broken in. 
False,0,"Negan is EXTREMELY against child and domestic abuse, which is shown in the comics very clearly. He wouldn't kill a child."
False,0,"They aren't going to kill a baby on AMC, it just won't happen. Unless it is Maggie and her unborn baby."
False,0,Well it is twd anything can happen 😂😂
False,0,Or will it make Rick stronger? 
False,0,I read that Negan was a mess but that would be just harsh really harsh if that happens 😔😔Rick will loose his mind and never come back😔😔
False,0,It's not an unthinkable idea. If people have read the comic book then they will know the kind of character Negan is so he is more than capable of doing that in the series six finale. However I think the more likely one is either daryl (or if Glenn is alive) meeting the wrong end of Negan's trusty weapon Lucille.  
False,0,I don't think he is going to kill Judith. I only heard that he is killing Glenn who supposedly is under a dumpster.
False,0,Snoop I saw you on ridiculousness😊 the host started talking about lacrosse. Your face was priceless you said what's that I don't know what that is😂😂 that is a whole white sport with a sprinkle of us👌👌although my daughter did play it 😳😳😳😳I found that to be funny (not busing on you at all)😉
False,0,Omg😳😳🙈🙈Sam is Jessie Rick new love son I'm sorry. Yes he does need to get some heart if he can steal chocolate for Carol then he can fight💆🏽💆🏽sorry for the confusion 👍🏼😊
False,0,taught
False,0,I thought my first son (Corde) to be tuff at 8 I taught my second son (Cordell) how to be tuff at 7 and I taught my daughter (Cori) to be tuff at 5
False,0,no Ron's the punk ass Sam just a bitch I taught my kids to be tuff when they was 10
False,0,Yes sam needs to stop being a bitch and blaming is mom for them not being prepared. Rick and the team is there now so no worries👍🏼👍🏼💆🏽💆🏽. He also need to stop stealing food(punk ass) I'm just saying ✊🏽✊🏽
False,0,Glenn isn't dead😁😳I won't believe it😊that was Glenn on the radio 👍🏼👍🏼watch.
False,1,I know he's not dead
False,1,I did see the preview of Nate dogs story coming up on unsung👍🏼I will be watching that episode 👌👌
False,0,People back at Alexandria don't need help think about it😏😏if it's not Glenn it's the people that jacked Darryl 😳😳😳they ran into that big ass heard that was coming their way🙆🏽🙆🏽that's why Darrell told them that they was going to be sorry when the chick apologized 😏just a thought 😳😳
False,0,I think it was Glen
False,0,I think the voice sounded exactly like Glenn's. 
False,0,I want it to be Glenn but it's not but Norman reedus said we will find out
False,0,I know for a fact that it's someone back at Alexandria. I would be willing to bet money on it. I'd rather it be Glenn but I'm positive it's someone back at Alexandria.
False,0,it was rick
False,0,I'm not gonna say anything about the new episode's until you caught up so don't trip lil homie
False,0,"Well I'm sorry for not watching 30 episodes in 5 minutes, common sense, like if I haven't watched the episodes doesn't mean you have to go all out on me. Like chill, I just don't wanna know what happens so please keep it to yourself and if you have something to say that's not polite, then don't say it at all. Thanks "
False,0,I bet the last episode Glenn comes back  because I thought Nickolas fell on top of Glenn I screamed when I saw the walkers tearing the flesh 
False,0,don't trip Steph I won't say anything about the new episodes until you caught up lil homie 
False,0,"Yeah seriously, we're allowed to do that. It's kinda the point. Don't like it? Don't open the app, or go to the website."
False,0,If you don't want spoilers don't even read anything because everyone here talks about new episodes 
False,0,I 
False,0,Nope
False,0,I kinda do and kinda don't 
False,0,Yah you're right . they dont. BECAUSE YOU SKIPPED. ! hahaha
False,0,Seriously? They don't show them using the bathroom but I'm sure they do it. 
False,0,Really😳😳Glenn and Maggie was always doing it 👅👅🙈🙈remember at the prison they were always in that tower getting busy😉😉Glenn was loving her long time 😂😂😂😂
False,0,"they fucked 1 time in season 2,  2
times in season 3 , and I think 1 time in season 4"
False,0,Lads they did it more then once 
False,0,you want to see proof they banged
False,0,They also don't have to show everything. 
False,0,I'm not 9 I just put madi09

False,0,Umm getting attacked by zombies is the whole point of the show 
False,0,I found this one https://youtu.be/mqrxhogu7oA and this one https://youtu.be/UXWFqxKU2qA
False,0,hold up let me see if I can find some rap music
False,0,Rap
False,0,"what you like rap, reggae, hip hopor Cadillac music"
False,0,yeah
False,0,No I didn't think he shot Darryl but I hope they die 😡😡
False,0,I jumped😂 I thought he was done for 
False,0,I got scared when he shot that gun
False,0,Nope at first I thought that too. But Daryl barely flinched. I knew he was just trying to scare him. 
False,0,Isn't Maggie supposed to become a leader?
False,0,He is killing Glenn 
False,0,I thought I read somewhere that he is supposed to first appear in episode 17. Would that be the finale? 
False,0,Maggie is not going to die . Because there is a lot but I could see Dwight and Shelly being apart of the saviors in the show . Negan would not appear on this season finale but it's possible to see him to make appearance in the next season because they just announced who is playing negan 
False,0,"Two Birds, One Stone... Rather then Dwight killing Abraham, they'll have Negan do in Abraham w/Lucille... Glenn's not going anywhere... Neither is Daryl.
Jesus will save Glenn (or at least get him back to Alexandria)... Like how Michonne brought back the Baby Formula to the Prison, similar to her Comic Introduction, but not ""the same""....
"
False,0,They wouldn't kill Maggie of or Daryl cause Daryl is Daryl 
False,0,Yeah I heard that that was supposed to be Dwight. Why do you think Negan's going to kill Maggie or Daryl? I know that there's been rumors about Daryl being killed off because of Norman Reedus' new show but it's only a 6 episode series. And I think they already filmed the whole thing. But why Maggie? I really don't get that one
False,0,That was Dwight and sherry.   According to IMDB.   I wonder if his face will get burnt with an iron later 
False,0,It's good but I want to know what the boy is🙆🏽😁when his eyes turn pitch black 👀👀you better watch out.but if you miss it it'll be on demand that night or the next day👍🏼👌😊

False,0,Me 2 but he ain't dead
False,0,he safe under the dumpster he may smell bad but he safe
False,0,I didn't say he was. I just said Norman confirmed that the voice on the walkie talkie at the end of the episode wasn't Glenn. I'm still holding on to the belief that he's still alive. But with Negan coming I'm very worried as to how long he will stay alive. 
False,0,he ain't dead
False,0,He is alive I'm positive I mean would they really kill off Glenn that's like killing of Daryl 
False,0,they want us to think he dead
False,0,Why is his name taken off the credits if he is still alive??
False,1,Honestly if he is not back in the 2015 episodes he's probably gone.
False,0,he alive 
False,0,please comment on what you guys think of the song

False,0,Negan is way worse then the governor. Negan makes the governor look about as intimidating as Eugene😂😂
False,0,That's negans group. And Negan is not a good guy. We will have ourselves a new governor very soon. Just worse. 
False,0,who are the saviors
False,0,In the comics it's the Saviors. It's about to get real good.

False,1,RUN DARYL RUN DARYL RUN DARYL 
False,0,that was Rick
False,0,Yes at the end of the episode he talks on the walkie talkie
False,0,yes he is
False,0,"I read an interview with kirkman saying that he has another ten years of story lines for Rick alone so yeah the comic should go on forever. However with the tv Series they have had to change storylines with characters because some characters are favoured by fans eg. Daryl and some characters are seen as an annoyance eg. Andrea. In the comics Andrea is a great character but in the tv show she has a pain in the back side and I found it difficult to enjoy watching scenes with her in. 

But at the same time. Like you said. You enjoy them both differently. "
False,0,"Just enjoy them both as something different... Also think of this, eventually the TV Series will end... The Comic Series...? Shall go on forever... It's already in its 12th/13th year... 
"
False,0,Idk tough question
False,0,I disagree. The comic book series has much better story lines. Although I'm not saying I don't enjoy the tv series. It is great.

False,2,"Surely not. 

Glens life comes to an end with negan bludgeoning him to death with his trusty weapon Lucille in the comic series. However if glen has now had his death in the tv series I think that daryl Dixon will have the death that glen received in the comic book series. 

There are rumours as well that Steven yeun has been seen filing more episodes for the walking dead. 

The best thing to do now is just wait and see what twists and turns will come out of series six. "
False,0,No

1) Intestines aren't located in the chest such as the ones being ripped apart, meaning it must have been from Nicholas's stomach on top of glen

3) He was just screaming, no tears, and wasn't even coughing out blood like everyone else that gets eaten
4) If you look closely at the end of that scene, it appears as glen slid right under the dumpster
5) A extremely familiar situation has happened in the video game in which the dude survived"

False,0,"Can you 
I want see that picture"
False,0,Def alive!! They ate Nicholas! Whike they ate him he moved under the dumpster and will set off a flare to get the walkers to head away from him.
False,1,Want me to quiz yall on twd 
False,1,"Its already clear that glenn is alive because there is a picture that he is taping a scene with another guy and i think that guy is the one who save him in the walking dead
"
False,0,Dead* lol 
False,0,I don't think hes dread. If you look it's Nicholas shirt and not Glenn so they arent eating Glenn. But there's like 50/50 chance so :'( 
False,0,maybe the gun was jammed
False,0,Glenn still alive 
False,0,i hope not
False,0,No he is not dead
False,0,If you look it's Nicholas shirt and not Glenn's.. But there's a 50/50 chance he is dead. 
False,1,"Apparently but there are thoughts that he escaped under the garbage can and the body being eaten was Nicholas.
 which I believe to be true "
False,0,He should be. I'm on comic 147 and it's just weird. 
False,0,"No. He will just put on another bandaid...Kirkman has said that he regrets cutting off Rick's hand in the comic, plus the cgi would be insane"
False,0,"@DurzoFlint there had to have been blood on the blade that cut rick's hand ( you know, considering it was stuck in a walker). In the comic the saviors  (led by Negan) cover their weapons in walker blood to have their enemies slowly become walkers if they don't fully kill them. It must be something more related to this as opposed to Rick just bleeding out."
False,0,I'm so worried about Ricks hand :'( 
False,0,"The only possible hallucination part would be Nicholas/Glenn situation. Rick will only need to patch up his cut. (No infection from Walker blood) Daryl, Sasha, Abraham finally run into some trouble?"
False,0,old version

False,0,Nah 
False,0,Lol
False,0,"HE'S DEAD MAN. GAME OVER MAN, GAME OVER"
False,0,"Also they were out of ammo...

How can Nicholas shoot himself without bullets"
False,0,Plus he really doesn't like defending himself and will willingly take blows just to give out punishment. 
False,0,Moon Knight is my favorite superhero and I don't like Batman so it pains me to say this but Batman would win cause Batman has a black belt in every martial art in the world plus he'll use gadgets and stuff while Moon Knight will try to fight straight up.

False,0,The whole history of the organization (Earth-616) in  the comic-book S.H.I.E.L.D #9 of this year
False,0,"Well, it was a branch off from the SSR. & It was founded by Peggy Carter, Howard Stark, & Chester Phillips after World War II when they defeated HYDRA. (This is all according to the MCU, I don't know if it's different in Earth-616)."
False,0,Nick fury. SR
False,0,I think Peggy Carter and Howard Stark started S.H.I.E.L.D sometime shortly after the time Steve went into the ice and the war ended. They started it to protect people from things like the Tesseract. 
False,0,If Marvel is involved it might be good. But FOX is always hit or miss with me. I wish Marvel had the rights to X-Men/mutants.
False,1,Fox were the guys that made the horrible Fan4 reboot
False,0,I look forward to the hellfire show
False,0,I heard it won't tie into the movies. Don't really plan on watching
False,0,Bucky will be the new cap
False,0,If Steve dead during civil war Bucky will be new captain (on comics).
False,0,"I doubt it... It seems like they want to move forward with falcon as the new cap, but hey, thats just my opinion!"
False,0,Yes 100% 
False,1,Ben reily
False,0,"Personally, Ben is my favorite."
False,1,"With Kaine theres the killing which, is a plus, but not funny, Ben was awesome though, being Peter's ""brother"" shows them having a good bond."
False,0,"I have been reading marvel comic since I was 10 ( I am 51!!!) and have to say that the story line of pretty much all the characters is getting way too complicated and confusing.
For Spider-Man in particular , I miss those beautiful stories that continue for several issues and that really focus on PETER ...I guess I am getting old!!! "
False,0,"Yeah, I totally agree. I really liked how they threw Sajani in though, it seems kind of funny having her in this."
False,0,"Its off to a great start, i see they are changing things and adding twitter and smart phones really helps id the era in which Peter lives. And Norman and Harry's hair style doesnt look like a black guy who just got waves ( yes im a black guy with waves, dont judge). "
False,1,Definitely recommend it! As everyone said it bodes greatly with the MCU. Marvel's goal is to have all of their movies & shows (on ABC & Netflix) connect in some way!
False,0,Ya it is cool
False,0,I recommend it. But it isn't necessarily a must watch. But when the Inhumans movie comes out. I think a lot of origin stories will be told through Agents of Shield
False,1,"My Recommendation, YES! Marvel's thing is EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED, so even in the smallest detail, somehow it's connected to the bigger picture "
False,0,"It's a great series, and it 100% connected to the movies. Before captain America winter soldier came out there was an episode of agents of shield where shield takes over, and when I watched the movie I knew that plot already. I was shocked "
False,0,It's great and goes along with the movie
False,1,"It's building up The Inhumans in a big way. Right now they're doing The Secret Warriors storyline and they have an annual crossover for whatever movie comes out at in may. They've been teasing Civil War. Now it's not a super hero show its a spy show with superhero elements so don't expect big CGI fest fights most of the times it's just hand to hand that might change a little because of the Secret Warriors forming. But if you like a show with great character interactions like in the movies, bad ass women, and great obscure characters that will never be in the movies watch it."
False,0,I recommended it
False,0,Agents of shield and Gotham are the only two superhero shows I can't get into
False,0,"I actually really recommend it. It does play well with movies (some more than others). The show has a pretty big budget too and with a good budget, comes a good show."
False,0,"Howard The Duck 



But actually Agent Venom"
False,0,I would prefer Iron Fist
False,0,I could see the Runaways as one
False,0,I could see that. Maybe a midnight sons 
False,0,I think Suicide Squad has a chance of making more money than both.
False,0,Borh
False,0,"People are more familiar with this epic duel of batman and superman. I would hope that civil gets more hype, but people who don't pay attention aren't going to know that spiderman will be in the movie. Everyone is focused on batman vs superman and Wonder Woman "
False,1,Civil War
False,2,"Civil War, everyone honestly knows who's going to win the fight between Bats and Supes."
False,0,Batman v Superman. I think a lot more people like Batman more than both Cap and Tony and Kal-El. 
False,1,But Spider-Man joining the MCU has way more buzz than Dawn of Justice 
False,0,"Dawn of justice of corse, everyone read in the comics the times that superman faced batman, but now to see it in the movies, is pure eye porn"
False,2,I think (and hope!) Cap 2 
False,3,"Civil War, off course"
False,0,I can't wait for the movie to be out
False,0,Pumped for this movie
False,1,"They should have made it a Captain America/Iron Man title, I feel they would focus so much more of Captain's side since its his movie."
False,0,Who isnt is lame 
False,0,Hyperion (Mark Milton)
False,0,I like classic the new guys are not than exciting to me 
False,0,Ms Marvel (Kamala Khan)
False,0,Inferno is new
False,0,I said NEW marvel character
False,0,Silver Surfer 
False,0,"Inferno, even though he can't fly."
False,1,Magneto
False,0,"Trust me. There is enough evidence to say 100% he's a mutant. 
1. He comes up on Cerebro
2. He's a mutant in the X-men days of future past comic
3. Richards has confirmed it multiple times
4. He says he is a mutant when he travels back to our time from the future in the Original sin Avengers comic (if I remember correctly)
"
False,0,Not the same thing
False,0,But they also said deadpool was a mutant a lot of times but he def wasn't. His whole deadpool carrer was a mutate.
False,0,"Franklin have an x-gen and it mention in a lot of comics: Fantastic Four, X-Men, Generation-X..."
False,0,Maybe he is 
False,0,But they said he was born with his powers and the celestials stated that he was beyond omega. I also dont remember sentinals attacking the Baxter Build for Franklin
False,0,"You also pretty much have to have the x-gene to be a mutant. If you are mutated without the gene, you're a [[Mutate]]."
False,0,"Secret Wars has made some stuff unknown at the moment and they could put him back to not being one, but in X-Men: The 198 Files #1, they said he's an Omega Level Mutant."
False,0,Teleporting is the best
False,0,"Super speed is awesome, it's pretty op. My favorite power is flying but you can fly with superspeed as well. So it's the best power "
False,0,Cant go wrong with the power of cheese
False,0,Cheese
False,0,Silver Surfer's power is my all time favorite
False,0,Love.....
False,2,Superspeed is good but the power to warp realty is awesome 
False,1,Superspeed
False,1,Spider sense
False,1,Healing Factor
False,0,"They never truly focus on thors power but I think Thor 3 is going to have a lot of work put into it, and they will execute him perfectly. I'm excited "
False,1,"It's not really that he's de-powered, just that they have trouble displaying his true strength.
"
False,1,But ragnarok is going to be good I hope 
False,0,@Theodoris Symidalas
False,0,Dudes know what exactly what I mean...^
False,0,Well....technically there is no thor 2 or 3. It-s Dark World and the  Ragnarok
False,0,"I think it's fair to say that Thor 1 and Thor 2 were good, but better than the other other movies...? Ehhhhhh "
False,0,How can they not be that good whwn it includes a god who is an avenger going on journeys across the galaxy 
False,1,"He's not de-powered, I just think the films simply aren't that good/not as good as the rest of marvel films. 
Also, if u think he's de-powered, Thor 3 is based off Ragnarok  and in Ragnarok in the comics, Thor get F***ed 
And Thanos will probably be in the film more than people think and rumor has it, he is going to fight Thor because Thor 3 is the last movie before Infinity war pt. 1, so they wanna show Thanos' might before tossing him in (basically his own movies). Just saying!
But, Thor is going to beat the Hulk in a fight in Thor 3 so that should show some power!
Sorry to get so into that! Lol 😅"
False,0,When was he de-powered  in the film?
False,0,Jessica Jones was pretty great consider Purple Man was portrayed by someone who fit the part so well. And Jessica Jones isn't a too far shot from 'The B- in Apt 23.'
False,0,Vision
False,0,Daredevil and Spidey
False,0,"Yea the ultimates 
"
False,0,I think right now I like The Ultimates the best!

False,0,Thats a pretty balanced team
False,1,"Captain America (Steve Rogers), Luke Cage, Thor (Jane Foster), Mr. Fantastic, Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), Doctor Strange "
False,0,"I don't feel like they're comparable. The art and storytelling styles are completely different. 

The new one is a mashup of alternate reality versions of the heroes you love. The old one is the heroes you love teaming up in ways you didn't expect."
False,0,I like the new one better. I felt the first one missed the mark with a lot of the characterizations. Also it felt much more rushed than the new one 
False,0,^ yes that too. DOOM IS A BOSS IN BOTH 💯
False,1,I love the original Secret Wars but I love the new too. Are different histories with a common name. Have the same principal villain...
False,0,The first had A LOT more action. The new one is a bit boring too. But I still love it!!!!!!!

False,1,"But what would howard really being to the team ,besides comic relief?"
False,1,"Im a big Howard fan! I have his first appearance in the comics, have his full Vol. 1, collect his series and is (yes I'm about to say this with a straight face) one of my favorite marvel characters for many reasons. 
But he simply cannot be put in a legitimate

False,0,Love Groot!! I think the flower has some more power than just to put a smile on someone's face... I remember see something on the cartoon about his flowers... I'll look into it.. Thanks for responding.... Hope you're having a CHEEZY day
False,0,"He didn't have any money to give her so he gave her the only thing he could give her, a flower. Groot loves to help people like in the comics when Captain Marvel was sad and crying then Groot walked up to her and hugged her. Groot is a child at heart."
False,0,It's either just before Cap 3 or just after

False,0,You can watch the avengers to see what loki did with the mind stone
False,0,You know what ... Let loki touch the powerstone and explode ... Done the end 
False,0,Yes but he already had one so why does he want another
False,0,The Reality Stone is way more powerful than The Mind Stone. Which is more effective controlling minds or bending reality to your will?
False,0,"The mind stone and reality stone have very different powers. Sure with the mind stone you can do a lot, but with the reality stone you can change not just how people think but how the the universe IS. Loki could make himself king of Asgard and he actually would be it, not just make people think it. "
False,0,He might be working with Thanos even though we don't really see it on screen. Loki is probably trying to help Thanos get all of the Infinity Gems to get something in return
False,0,What would he have done if he had the mind stone
False,1,"I think it's a great idea that would make a good movie, who gives a crap if he's black it would still make a good movie, and trust me that no offence stuff does not make your reply less offencive. I bet you white, black , Chinese and other cultures would like to see that movie."
False,0,"I think it's a good idea who freaking gives a crap if he's black, I would definitely see that movie.  And that no offence stuff doesn't make your reply any less  offencive  "
False,0,I say start off with an animated series first.
False,0,"Non comic readers would be both confused and upset when spidy turned balck (no offense) Spidey is such a all known and old character and people don't generally like change. I would not rule it out, nobody thought they would make a guardians movie and it was a hit. "
False,0,Not me
False,0,Its good. I think the way they'll do it if he's ever in a film is Spidy will die at the end of the third film of his new MCU trilogy and Myles will be there to take up the persona. 
False,0,I do and did any one see that short video of miles morales
False,1,Me
False,1,Me
False,2,"I know this will probably never happen, but I would like a multivers movie with him in it"
False,0,You could always ask the actual writers of the handbooks over at marvunapp.com...
False,2,"so you should like the post to get as many people as possible, especially Moon Knight fans, to like the page and make Marvel aware of the blatant glaring oversights of this character. A MCU film would be awesome if they include Moon Knight as it will be just the introduction he needs for further films. He can be a full champion for Marvel if they want him to be and market, cast and write well for him. As it is if they write for how Marvel has scored him currently he will be nothing more than some brain dead moron running around punching people. That is so not how even they have written him even from the very first comic. With a change to his ratings will see people more interested in him as for non fans he has no attributes attracting them. If you found he was rated accordingly then many would be more likely to seek out who he is."
False,1,"Those are some excellent points. While I do think he is widely poorly rated, there have been rumors for an MCU film. Think of Guardians of the Galaxy, I'm probably one of the only people to have already read the comics. "
False,0,But it would be awesome if they make one with Amadeus cho hulk he is totally awesome
False,0,You should make it at 2017
False,0,Their bringing Thunderbolt Ross back in Civil War so we might get a hint. And It would be a perfect place to introduce She-Hulk. 
False,0,It might not happen till phase 4 
False,0,I'd be so down for that. But then I would think hmmm what a waste of an opportunity to make the planet hulk film...
False,0,That would be a cool reveal. Probably a mystery film for phase 3
False,0,Ehh..not what I exactly wanted.
False,1,I know its awesome
False,0,Actually he would kill Barry but Cisco shot him with something like a gun. Then he left
False,0,"I got to lay My guess on Daddy Henry Allen. They got the same bodyshape, the area around the eyes are similar.

A friend and I guess that is why he doesen't Kill Barry the first time 😊 "
False,0,Wally West's (Flash) enemy. Zoom has the uniform of Eobard Thawne (Reverse-Flash). He's name is Hunter Zolomon from Earth-1. Atleast in the comics. In the series i have no idea who he is.
False,0,"*facepalm do you watch the flash? He's on it right now, it's a great show. "
False,0,He's a DC Flash Villain who is super fast. That's just about all I know about him
False,0,I'm pretty sure that is DC
False,0,"Also I think a S6 movie will most likely happen in response to DC's all villain movie ""Suicide Squad"" which is expected to make pretty good money."
False,0,Thanks and is would be awesome to see hulk verse The Lizard
False,1,Drew Goddard said there is still a possibility that they will do it after they establish the new Spider-Man. 
False,0,They cancelled the Sinister Six movie. 
False,1,"Yes. The main thing u basically need to know is that Sony and Marvel entertainment share Spider-Man equally. Spider will 100% be in the movie continuity and yes, to answer ur question, if Sony makes a S6 movie, it would be with The Avengers, GotG, Agents of SHIELD, Daredevil, ect. Spider-Man and everything that goes with Spider-Man (villains, people, and all related as well). 
* Also good to know is that in the deal between the 2 companies, Sony has the right, and will use this right, to include Marvel Characters like Iron-Man, Cap, Thor, Hulk, Daredevil, ect. to appear in his movie! 
Hope that answered ur question! "
False,0,"Well, they said it's going to be in 2016 and I don't think that they'll do another one in 2016.."
False,0,No
False,0,There's a rumor that it's going to debut next week

False,0,Me to
False,0,Im still waiting on the movie 
False,0,It's debuting in front of Star Wars. Marvel and Fox are collaborating together now.
False,0,X-Men Apocalypse you say?

False,0,I hate deadpool I mean my least favorite anti hero is him I don't like Ryan Reynolds either so a perfect match for deadpool
False,0,"Who would win in a fight?

Logan vs Tony 

Who will win!?!?!?"
False,0,"Yeah marvel shouldn't come up with that, even though he's a mercenary he still has a little good in him, hey that's what i think.

As always leave a comment peeps. :D"
False,0,Yall should just hope that we dont have DEADPOOL KILLS MARVEL UNIVERSE movie 
False,0,"If marvel and Fox do get along, they need to finish the fight of hulk vs wolverine, and the incredible hulk because at the end of the incredible hulk, they showed tony and it seemed 2008 bruce learned how to control the hulk, well that's what i think. 

Leave a comment on this one as well, tell us what you think down below!  :D"
False,0,Me too. Now that Marvel and Fox seems to be getting along hopefully down the line we'll get a big universal crossover event. 
False,1,"Just give meh some replies, who knows maybe i'll even answer some of them in time, get it ""in time""? Hahahahaha of course you don't.   -sigh- 

Well yeah just give me some thoughts of what you think about the DEADPOOL movie and tell me, no no no i mean us what you think because we all need to spread the word like a helicopter.

False,0,I'd like to see an X-Men and Avengers cross-over and maybe even a new Fantastic Four reboot considering the last one sucked majorly. The third spot should be a Hulk movie because I feel like Marvel could do a way better job now that the MCU has become bigger and more popular. 
False,0,I would love for the rights to come back to marvel and finally get the fantastic four we deserve 
False,0,"I think Ghost Rider might be a good Netflix show. The CGI needed to show the skull and flame, bike effects, ect. might be a bit over budget for a Netflix show though, so a Movie of the character might bring him more justice."
False,1,X-Men? I really hope it's X-Men.
False,0,"Robert Downey Jr has been pretty adamant that he doesn't want to continue with solo Iron Man films, so I feel it's very unlikely that Iron Man 4 will be one of the films.

I really want to see the long-discussed Hulk sequel, and while it's unlikely, I'd love to see Marvel take a crack at a Ghost Rider movie.





"
False,0,I hope it's a new hulk. It's been a while since he was in the spotlight. As for the other two I hope it's for super heros that haven't been in a movie like moon night.
False,0,If one of them was Iron-Man 4 that would be a bold move for Marvel
False,1,"I'm hoping for Namor, She-Hulk and The Thunderbolts."
False,0,Um no not realy
False,0,"Well, at least a little cameo would have been nice."
False,0,"Let the show live man. 
Was the series good the way it was?
It was great to have Luke in the series.
And Nurse ""Betty""(I forgot her name already) in it was a plus. 
Enjoy and hopefully Luke Cage's series drops sooner than later"
False,1,Because their planning The Defenders. Having Daredevil show up in there would take away from the experience when her and Luke meets up with him and Iron Fist. Claire told her to call him but she said she had to do it herself. Having Daredevil come in and help this early would make her look like a weak character. 
False,0,It's in current time mcu before civil war and after antman 
False,0,I think it's after the avengers age of Ultron but I could be wrong the best way to find out is look out for references to other super heros and villains and events
False,0,But I Want To Know Which Avengers Movie It Takes Place Is It In Phase 3 Or Phase 2 Or 1 Does It Takes Place After Ant Man
False,0,Well Jessica is in Hells Kitchen where Daredevil lives and she has to stop her enemy the Purple Man
False,1,"The setting of Jessica Jones is Hells Kitchen, New York. This is the same setting as Marvel's other Netflix series 'Daredevil'."
False,0,Sorry. The real name of the axe is Jarnbjorn
False,0,Maybe a sword or Jarborg the axe
False,0,Just watch thor tales of asgard
False,0,Nope it was a sword 
False,1,Mjolnir. 
False,0,Who would be the next antagonist ?
False,0,"Don't know for season 2. But she will appear on The Defenders (2017)
"
False,0,I wouldn't be heart broken if she did not come back for season 2
False,0,Me too 
False,0,"Eh, it was okay. The first half of the show was great, however, the second half faltered quite a bit and lost it's stepping. The subplots became way too convoluted and none of them really had any good conclusions. Purple Man, as a villain sucked, David Tennant was quite under utilized. However, the best part of the show was Mike Colter's 'Luke Cage'."
False,1,Honestly they shouldve started earlier with someone else 
False,1,The new avengers first came about after the event dissassembled where the avengers were essentially split up. The new avengers includes characters like cap and black panther. 
False,1,Gaming man is actually ant man (hank pym) 
False,0,The orginal were Iron man Thor Hulk Giant man and Wasp
False,0,I know the original for avengers but not new avengers
False,0,"Apologies for the delay in updates comrades, I released the gorillas, and it was glorious. They didn't seem too happy about being locked up in that little room, however they simply could not be tamed. I had to hide in the FEV lab. (Or, you know..I had to go to work, and stuff)"
False,0,Lol
False,0,Did you do that for real? Bcz it would be so awesome 
False,0,Lol
False,0,"I could never kill my son
"
False,0,"Haha yeah. Once I figured out that I probably wasn't coming back, I just ran though that place and stole everything. And I mean everything!"
False,0,Sounds about right lol.  I did that twice XD
False,0,This is probably the best post I've seen on here yet. Keep us updated on your troll quest against the Institute haha
False,0,I hope to see more of this
False,0,"Count me in! More entries, this is fucking golden"
False,0,I'm not sure about legendary. I know nodded guns are safe though
False,0,Modified guns will have unlimited ammo not sure about legendary
False,0,I was so glad when I found that out.  I was leaving 100 rounds in every npc hoping it would be enough.  Now they get like 15 to be safe lol
False,0,"I have heard varying theories on this.. If you modify a weapon, do they still have unlimited ammo with that weapon? Also, I've heard if you give them a legendary weapon that fires projectiles of any kind, they do not have unlimited ammo... Is this true? Thanks"
False,0,Really? I saw a settler with a assult rifle. I'm guessing that she picked it from a dead raider that attacked a settlement. I'm going to stock them all with assult rifles and shotguns 
False,1,I would guess 5-10 because it fires about abpit much in VATS
False,0,Awesome. Do you know how many bullets the mini gun needs?
False,0,Thanks.  Good tip. Saves more ammo for me to sell lol
False,0,Sweet. Gonna give everyone a plasma rifle
False,1,I've been saying that for awhile now and I want to clarify it isn't a dog yip. I'm saying yup just twice in a row for emphasis
False,0,"Well over 200, almost 300"
False,0,I just it 9 days yesterday hahaha.
False,0,He he only 20...hundred
False,0,Last I checked it said I had 8 days of play so around that 190 mark I guess
False,3,I'm old. I work 60-70 hrs per week and I still hit that 100 hrs like a bottle of scotch -quick and with the fury of a much younger man 
False,0,THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT THATS THEM REAL FUCKIN HOURS
False,1,Passed it days ago lol 
False,2,Lol .... I'm over 300 already :)
False,0,Woohoo

False,0,Lol 
False,1,"Scummy, when you open the trade menu .  You can give settlers clothes and equip them.  Just select the armor, then look at the bottom fir the equip.  Their current clothes do not appear in inventory,  but you can see them after they equip another piece of clothing (such as harness). Apparently they didn't want us to have naked settlers running around every where."
False,1,I had a test and my intelligence wasn't high enough I should've killed a few people first to get the next level up.
False,2,"I changed my dogs name to dogmeat, but now he don't listen, and won't keep the fucking welding goggles on!"

False,0,It's gotten to the point that I dream about it and wake up confused like wasn't I just playing fallout. 
False,0,"Im 14 and im a freshman. I've lost all friends because I moved. None of the younger kids have true problems, and none of the adults understand that adolescent minds feel a lot of pressure for things like chores and school."

False,1,brother you are damn sure not the only one ... I'd settle with no bills lol 
False,3,Lord have mercy. These kids nowadays really don't understand how fucking sweet it is to not have any responsibility besides chores and school. I'd kill to have it that easy again
False,0,Dude I was kidding I already said
False,0,Son
False,0,Im not it was a threat to get him to stop saying he was gonna kill me n my family n for him also to stop saying i rape my som

False,2,"Sometimes you just gotta place it anywhere then stand farther back, pick it again and it'll click better. 
Another thing I noticed is a piece might not place In a spot on its own but if you place like a floor section out from where you want it then attach another piece it'll click in to place in the original spot that wouldn't work (hope that makes sense cause I'm a little lost and I wrote it)"
False,1,I am fine I know how to cope with it every time it pisses you of just kill the closest person.

False,1,Yes
False,0,Im assuming it's bugged. I haven't done anything else or taken any perks that would've boosted headshot accuracy. I just noticed it started happening after I got MacCready's perk
False,0,But it seems like it's bugged. I dunno doe :/
False,0,Oh shit is that why? I was wondering why I had 95% on head shots but like 25% on a torso haha. That explains alot.
False,0,It boosts head shot chance by 25% and it's additive not multiplicative.

False,0,"Yeah i got you. He had no right to say any of that. Then afterwards claim he's joking. Especially when he knows you're a father and shit. But he's just a kid. You shouldn't let him get to you.

I say you should just post an apology and take his name off your bio. I don't care if you don't mean it. It'll just help this whole thing go away.

Again. I know this isn't your fault. But I think it would be for the greater good."
False,0,Yea just have him stop talking shit bout me and midnight.  Both have been talking shit bout me since i went off on him for saying he was gonna fuckin kill me.  How would u feel if someone said that to u.  U wouldnt be pissed.  N i said before i know i shoulda left it alone.  Just wish it was back in my day where there was none of this internet bullying   How could someone say ill kill u and ur family over the internet.  Only a child would.  N now u see why i dont add kids.   N u saw thats all i said first 
False,0,"Just calm down. I'm not saying either was right or wrong. They both said kinda stupid things (yes, even you poopbags. You know we're homies but you should've just left it  alone).

Is there anyway I can get you too two settle this? This whole thing isn't good for anybody."
False,0,Wow kid ur in everypost.  U really gotta keep goin huh till i leave.  Fuck u midnight.  N go eat ur moms ass
False,1,"No adult, that has kids especially. Should be speaking to a kid like that, and getting butthurt over an online comment. How many times do I have to explain this to you. I honestly don't believe you have kids, because from the way your acting they would be in horrible shape. Technically speaking from how immature you are. "
False,0,Guess hes just being stupid.  I know i should ignore it but like i said noone (kid) wise should talk to adult like that
False,1,Seriously!

False,0,I can never bring myself to be evil and it was so hard to get the evil trophies in Fallout 3
False,2,Nice! I just walk into settlements and take what I want and build a giant fortress and watch the people come after me in vain. Oddly satisfying.
False,1,I did that on my 2nd except the Prydwen had a malfunction with some c4....
False,2,Yeah I did the same except in my second playthrough I was the biggest jerk. No one liked me. I walk around the Prydwen and get the angriest looks.
False,0,Same
False,0,lmfao to funny 
False,1,Yeah I've scraped a few things in a flurry that I hadn't intended. My fingers are working faster then my brain and that good stuff goes out the window. 😭 oh well 
False,0,It's a pain sometimes for sure. I might add a '*' before the names of the items I want to keep to see if it helps.
False,0,"Been there, maybe mark inventory as ""important or special"" I've scraped multiple items that I didn't want to."
False,0,Sorry word not ford
False,0,Arrow up if it worked

False,0,Absolutely!
False,2,New vegas killed it.  Coolest armors and weapons out of any fallout were in new vegas
False,0,I love New Vegas bit i shall agree. It's way easier than Fallout 3. But Fallout 3 isn't fun hard. It's annoyingly hard
False,0,They made nv for the people who enjoyed the original fallout games and as a not to the old devs 
False,0,All the way. I think they created nv for all the people that thought 3 was to hard
False,0,Nope
False,0,Meeeeeeeeee 
False,0,When in doubt make sure you have a fatman.
False,0,Yar
False,0,You should have the option to punch them all to death. Then die of starvation once you run out of food and die in the vault. End of story
False,2,When in doubt get in a random Decontamination chamber' that's little colder then usual
False,0,Then you just need a suppressed .50 sniper and a nice roof 😁
False,2,Lol I haven't gotten level 4 on science yet to do it but trust me that's next on the list haha. I wish I could have the stealth boy mod and the jet pack on at the same time

False,1,Brotherhood even though they're asses but give you cool stuff
False,0,What the fuck
False,0,I was just curious how a beautiful lady would go through. Would she look innocent and ball gag u as you turn your back. Or will she layover and expose her belly. I prefer the first choice.
False,0,Awesome and interesting.  Like I said I have been mostly polarizing.  Next play through I will try and be either evil or good 100%.  
False,1,I'm always play good the first time try to do thing the way I would them for real if possible or at least in the best way to benefit the community. But in my second play I do everything opposite I'm a completely evil bitch. I play these games throughly I want to see every possible play through. 
False,0,I'm assuming you are 25 years old?
False,1,Haha I started out the nice guy but for some reason finding it more and more exciting to be bad👿.  To the point I see silhouettes of wooden spoons out of the corner of my eye
False,0,"I am a woman and cannot play as a villain. I'm generally goo,t but sometimes make mean decisions to benefit myself, like stealing or untimidating.  In my 2nd play through of games I try to be evil but just cannot bring myself to make evil decisions and kill good people."

False,0,Mods are free on console if you watched the presentation by Bethesda you would know 
False,0,I hope not. That's what makes mods so cool but yea with consoles that's a totally different animal to deal with as far as copyright
False,0,I'm worried Microsoft and Sony won't allow 3rd party content in the mods. I don't know where modding falls on the spectrum of copyright infringement. But maybe if the mods are free that won't be an issue
False,1,Lol thanks Virtuoso
False,1,Everything I want for future mods is what you wrote so good job on that :p
False,0,The only thing they exclude and won't let you use on the console is nudity mods
False,0,Instead of like me where their everywhere but nowhere 
False,0,Unless you want them so you can remember where they are
False,0,Yes but it's kinda pointless. If you have enough beds then they seem like they are happy.

False,0,"Yeah, I'm one of the people that hyped about the deliverer. It's a very well made gun. "
False,0,I wear it cuz I put armor over it
False,1,No. The Sole Survivor and the Lone Wanderer characters didn't have the same connection with the vault. In FO3 I felt like it was my home. But now I feel like it's a prison for the Sole Survivor.
False,0,Hi
False,0,I usually do as well. I feel like it'd be much more comfortable than most other clothing in the wastes.
False,1,Oh hey mrbadman
False,2,I put it on for the memories 
False,0,😉
False,0,N hope he understands i dont add anyone under 18. 
False,0,Exactly. 
False,1,"Both of yall are cool, we just acted stupid for a little bit. Lol"
False,1,I said it was fine yo lol.  No biggie. 
False,0,I didn't make it worse u made it better it finally stopped
False,0,815 ✊✊✊
False,1,No problem ssj. U my homie from 815 yo 
False,1,"No, I'm just wanting to say I'm sorry. If you won't forgive me than that's fine. Btw, don't be like me and interfere with something that's not your business."
False,1,Am I an attention whore?
False,0,See? That's what I was going for! I appreciate it midnight and bags. Just let the fallout continue.
False,0,Yes it is just him but oh well its his opinion i guess
False,0,Its ok midnight i forgive u. 
False,0,Just you
False,1,Is it me or is this guy a big attention whore?
False,0,"No, I'm not leaving. You don't have to either. Sorry, I was in the wrong."
False,0,Ight.  This apps gone.  Thats why i said that.  Just wanted to make sure it was u. 
False,0,I got you. I'm about to have a beer then I'll hop on.
False,0,Ok I'll add u later like on the 18th cuz yeah 
False,0,Mine is BananaButt29
False,0,The only way I would accept fallout as a multiplayer game is if it were local co-op only. Multiplayer online games are filled with assholes who like to Fuck up people's lives in games. I'm over that shit.
False,0,There is an online fallout called fonline reloadided look it up
False,0,"I hear you guys, but the story was so short! I want more destruction lol"
False,0,"I just don't want them to focus on that. Nowadays, there are games without stories. Fallout does its job by countering that!"
False,0,it would suck as much as it would be awesome lol but they would have to find a perfect way to match up ranked players 
False,1,"Co-op would be great, too. I just think it would add a little substance to the game. Maybe not during the story mode, but if it were it's own game mode. Kinda like GTA"
False,2,I'm about co-op. But multiplayer would suck...
False,1,yea ... you know what I'm tlkn 
False,1,"Wiped them out like an outbrea(wipe em out)
Choppa start busting tryna make the house shake (trrra)"
False,0,"Its alright. I don't mind repeating information.

Justice is a few thousand caps if I remember correctly...so bring lots of stuff to trade."
False,0,Oh sorry I forgot. I probably should have read the old posts. My bad 
False,0,"As I said, you can buy it from Penny Fitzgerald at Covenant."
False,0,Cool. Where's it at?
False,0,"Well, it has the chance to stagger opponents. It also as fairly higher damage than normal shotguns, I believe. It's a pretty awesome name, too."
False,0,What's so special?
False,0,"It's a unique shotgun. You can buy it from Penny at Covenant, I believe."
False,0,What's this Justice I've been hearing about?
False,0,"Justice is probably my favorite gun so far, actually. "
False,0,"I've been using the Justice alot. I'll have like 100+ shells. But with a 32 she'll clip, I run out in no time."
False,0,Yes there is leaked gameplay
False,0,"SSJ3, why would you bring the damn thing up then? "
False,0,Dude I've been on pornhub there is no fallout
False,0,Guise.....Staaaaahp
False,1,shhhhh everyone lets just talk about Fallout
False,0,That's what I mean by perpetuating the situation ^^^^^
False,0,"Okay, now he's back. Right when I say something. How strange is that."
False,0,Whatever man. I'm done with this.
False,0,I wasnt told by anyone either to get off here.  
False,0,Theres real milk on this game lol.  Holy shit i need to get strong back
False,0,One time i was building in my settlement in FO4 and i keep hearing this weird noise over and over again and i look over and a fucking glitched out Dogmeat is walking around under a wooden shack foundation while sneezing REPEATEDLY! I had to fast travel away to get it to stop lmao

False,0,well ill stay if it stops.  i just hate drama lol.  yall have been cool tho ^^^
False,0,Sorry. I think it's coming to an end though.
False,1,Sorry you gotta go man. Good luck
False,1,I just make my character fat and have sex with piper while doing important things on my settlement 
False,1,I think about sex quite a lot

False,1,"Curie

False,0,piper gives you...  sweet rolls    her perk is extra xp for dialogue success and extra for finding new locations
False,0,"Nick Valentine hacks terminals.

There's more but I like the One answer per person trend we have going here lol"
False,0,MaCready gives ammo. That includes fusion cores
False,0,Piper gives sweetrolls
False,0,"Strong is strong and can carry a lot and has an awesome melee perk, but he's impossible to impress so it's hard to get the perk because he hated everything."

False,1,N he just wont stop n noone else like midnigt talking crap would actually read what's going on 
False,1,Yes 
False,0,"I understand PB doesn't want kids and Banana is 12. So I'm going to assume Banana asked for a friend request PB said no l, Banana got mad and it escalated from there. Correct?"
False,0,Ok i forgive u now fucking stop already.  Damn. I dont add people under 18.

False,0,?
False,0,Yeah I'm confused too.
False,0,what
False,0,I read earlier this guy was drunk around noon getting high in the bathroom bitching about his wife.  (Great father material  btw).  Maybe he'll wake up in the morning and realize what a piece of shit he is and stop being butt hurt about comments from a 12 year old on the Internet.  Smdh.
False,2,"Damn,  a 35 year old can't spell"
False,0,Im talking about people like this👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻

False,0,Dude c'mon act mature about this u don't need me to get kicked off this and xbox
False,2,"I'm 13 btw, and I'm probably 100x more intelligent."
False,1,"Actually, I'm trying to prove how ignorant you are. Then, you're commenting back saying stuff like ""stupid ass bitch gtfo."" So..... you're the one in the wrong."
False,0,N u r no better huh midnight
False,2,"Wow, your definitely the most immature ""dad"" I've ever heard of. You're arguing over a comment online. That's all I need to say. "

False,0,Yea it drives me crazy not being able to move stuff up and down
False,1,On Xbox is there a way to move an item up and down? I can spin them and move them closer and farther away from me but can't figure out up and down
False,0,"Agreed, how sad is it that if a update were to come out including new pieces to build with id actually be excited 😂"
False,1,Yeah it's a real bother to build sometimes and others it's a breeze. I hope they improve it or a good mod comes out
False,0,😂😂😂😂😂 dumbasses
False,0,I love the stupid ass comment guys.  Kill me some more 
False,0,I know right midnightsniper

False,0,Rivet city
False,0,"Too true. Plus, the building possibilities are endless."
False,0,"I do like Spectacle Island quite a bit. It'd be a nice little place to make a home...if you could manage to kill off the mirelurk a, of course"
False,0,"Without all the monsters, rads, and lack of attractive women, I'd say Spectical Island man. That place is awesome  "
False,0,Fair enough. I'd probably want to visit the NCR myself.
False,0,Fucking nowhere?!?... Ok maybe sanctuary hills with out it being nuked

False,0,I agree w jj n the other dude lol.  N jj u got a xbox bro
False,0,I put them in all special perks   4 to each n them got em all maxed out now lol
False,0,"Just spread out evenly, each one will have something you want later down the road "
False,1,That's a great way^ but you also don't want to cut yourself short by playing catch up when you level up. It is quite hard to get everything else up to speed if all your chips are in one pot.
False,0,Put them into Strength and agility. All of the agility perks are great
False,0,"I'm 10 too,"
False,0,Hey Lego batmans pretty cool
False,0,"you literally make no sense, kid. sell fallout and get yourself lego batman or something for christmas, this thread was a waste of both our times."

False,0,Mr juice be nice 🍹
False,0,Connect Tv's

False,0,And I'm 12 everybody stop acting like in 4 cuz my dad loves me and he thinks I'm nature he thinks I'll be very successful in my life but he said my brothers not so much
False,0,This is how I feel right now if Poop bags was my dad I'd kill him in his sleep but in a couple weeks when I get over the sh*t in my life I'll say sorry 
False,0,If anybody wants to know why ive been acting like this is because ny mom divorced my dad then last night they had s*x in the room right next to me then she left again and i hate her I usually don't care what people say about Me but it's a tough time for me right now 
False,0,Sooooorrrrrrryyyyy

False,0,Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
False,0,Plz already I'm so sooooo sorry
False,0,I got one!   Works pretty good.    Just makes a weird knocking sound once it's locked on then just fire away so long as you pointed in their general direction.  
False,0,Does it have target lock like locks on to someone and hut them no matter what
False,0,Ya I actually found one with the quad attachment on a trap that almost killed me 
False,0,Haha thanks
False,0,Nope but I love your name.
False,0,My favourite place to build is spectacle island walled off the tower area so no one can shut it down.   Super protected the boat gen.   Then built a massive 5 story fortress of raider doom.   
False,0,Use Abernathy Farm. I built a huge mutfruit farm (175 food) and have a large house and walked off the entire area
False,0,Yep
False,2,I build all the time. It's my favorite thing to do on this game.
False,0,Yeah I built a little bit during the story but now that I'm done. I'm starting to build a lot since the settlements are like another game themselves.
False,0,Seems like its the only thing to do to lvl up after beating it from what ive heard
False,0,Im w vs.  i havent done any building just only inside my home plate house.  I wanna beat the game before i build 
False,1,Actually I'm going to live stream on my twitch this build when I start. I'll start around 2:55pm est. My twitch is liqudforce134
False,1,My main base is the castle
False,2,Red rocket is my home base it's pretty sick I keep all my followers there. But no settlers never put up the radio. 
False,0,Mini nuke sparkles and mini gun glitter 
False,1,Any pink power armor needs sparkles and glitter.
False,1,I will destroy everyone with my pink X-01 armour bah ha ha
False,1,Lol love it. The power armor only gets better too 
False,1,And soon you deeeeestroy the entire world at the beginning of the game. ^^
False,0,And skyrim as well
False,0,"I played 3 and New Vegas, I wish I could play the originals. "
False,0,I played fallout 3 halfway but didn't get to finish. Same with oblivion. Bc I didn't really know how to appreciate the gameplay and mechanics but then skyrim came out and I loved it and that's how I feel about 4. This game is so addicting
False,0,You can't get the full experience unless you play at least fallout 3. 
False,0,It indeed is amazing but makes me very angry at times 
False,1,My first Bethesda game
False,1,It's my first and I'm addicted 
False,1,Yes that's me first and I fucking love it. 
False,0,"Wasteland, then Fallout 2."
False,1,"Yo I suggest you try out three. It's pretty great, also I'm sure you'd enjoy seeing what fallout four evolved from"
False,0,Lol
False,0,I not Phillip I donoven
False,1,Hahaha sorry I was just saying. You'll find some friends on here no problem.
False,0,Phillip ????
False,0,Lol
False,0,Im still a friend even tho u are wayyyyy younger than me.   Seems like im the mama murphy of the bunch lik
False,0,I guess
False,1,Ok thank u
False,1,People are pretty nice on here. Some can be dicks though.
False,0,"Or hey, maybe you were just preparing for fallout 4"
False,0,Very sad.  I hated accidentally picking it up
False,0,He sad thing is I collected all this crap in Fallout 3 just because! 
False,1,In combination with the faster AP regen perk it's not to bad.  Just gotta stand still for the most part lol.
False,2,Yes strong back perk is great!  Except it still sucks to be overencumbered in battle
False,2,Strongback perk is a godsend.  Level 3 lets you walk normally while overcumbered (at the cost of AP).  Level 4 lets you fast travel.
False,2,My bed is made of teddy bear And it's comfy as Fuck. I'm completely happy Idk what y'all are complaining about
False,2,How you can make a wall/floor from a couple of pencils and battered clipboards is also a mystery. 
False,2,"Yeah typewriters, fans, and phones are my go to. Plus anything that has wood in it. How you get 2 pieces of wood from a toy car is anyone's guess."
False,0,I never walk by a shiny can or dinner/surgical tray! 😂. I have set up my crops so I can make vegetable starch. Never ending supply of adhesive. 
False,0,dogmeat is annoying af sometimes cuz he blocks doorways Dx
False,0,I want chocolate 
False,0,Lol.  I want a pitbull. Or a baby pittie
False,1,He's cool. I hope there's a mod that comes out that you can turn him into a different dog. I want a weimaraner! Haha.
False,0,Shadowed army helmet
False,0,Use the army helmet
False,1,Red bandana might be cool. But it goes over your face.
False,0,"Agree with the above, just travel between sanctuary and bunker hill."
False,0,Yup
False,0,Ok thanks for the help
False,0,Or sanctuary i find her there almost everytime i go there.  Sometime without her brahmin
False,0,Trashcan Carla? The trader? Idk. I'd try Bunker Hill. Alot of the NPC traders come out of there.
False,0,Melee.
False,0,Thanks guy's!! Yeah I just started playing I'm level 17 
False,0,"As said before, that perk is actually pretty OP. I have over 2,000 rounds for almost every weapon I have besides explosives."
False,1,Yeah just sell the chems and ammo you don't use. It's touch and go at first.
False,0,Put that shit on easy clear out a bunch of places n store all ur junk n shit n turn it back on ur regular setting n ull have tons of ammo
False,0,Lol
False,2,I was having that problem and it's so expensive but with two levels of the ammo finder perk and I have over 200 rounds for ever gun

False,0,Prescription lol.  U mean card lol 
False,0,I got an adapter for my mic and I don't know if It works. I'm going to puck up a live prescription too. Idk if it ran out or not.
False,0,Ok so the spider one is ur account? Lol n thats ok badman i forgive u ur old enough.  Let fear know ill brb i gotta do homework again lol.  My son is home from school n he has some but i will return to party it up very soon not much to do homework wise

False,0,Cait
False,0,"Hancock, he's just Hancock "
False,0,This is what makes it so hard to pick! They each have really useful things 😅

False,1,"Curie, she is nice and also can make you less stimpaks ;)"
False,0,Alexander station or whatever it's called. The one with the raiders. Has a full set
False,1,You can steal stuff and get away from it if you're [HIDDEN]

False,0,RobCo Galleria
False,0,Cabot house
False,1,Free fall legs I bet 
False,1,What difficulty? That's a tall ass building. I always play survival :p
False,1,"I can jump off that, no power armour, and live"
False,0,It would be nice if it worked on my phone
False,0,I have max dwellers (200)
False,0,Its nice to play every now and again
False,0,It's good for a phone game but I lost interest pretty quick

False,1,"Only happens eveytime i see an enemy. Then i stand up, just as i'm raising the pip boy again i hear all the enemies have now spotted me. SMH"
False,0,I know but damn its so annoying. I don't want to quit sneaking and reveal my position every time I check my inventory.
False,0,You could use your pip boy while you're standing
False,0,Go some ware with a lot of caps get them save and exit restrat the game  and keep doing that in that one place over and over
False,1,Water is the best way. You need a lot of defense though.
False,2,"You have a water purifier you built in sanctuary that feeds purified water into your work bench, it's an unlimited supple just go and sell them."
False,1,Sell your ammo or chems
False,2,Put a couple points into the first perk under luck.  And exchange pre war money for caps rather than store it as junk. 
False,2,Go to Diamond City and sell all the weapons you don't use. Pipes guns for exemple.
False,3,I'm serious 
False,0,Haha
False,3,Sell your companions to slavers 
False,1,"Phantom Pain was alright, its been pretty neglected since Fallout came out tho. I'm not gonna be easily seayed to a franchise when I've been on this franchise for over 8 years, take your petty words elsewhere"
False,1,"Fuck that dude.
Get outta here with that phantom cock bullshit.
Only phantom pain u feel is in ur anus where the cock was last night while u stayed up all night playing it."
False,0,Ok so what's your point
False,1,Why'd have the app then
False,2,I have pain for you.
False,0,There are also 300+ locations. 
False,0,There are more than 15 settlements I have at least 21 so far
False,0,Yes there is go to IGN they have an interactive fallout 4 map with all locations
False,2,Can you post a pic of your map cause there's no reliable map with all locations on the internet yet 
False,1,"I'm not saying discover them, I'm saying build there. "
False,0,I read somewhere there may be close to 30 settlements. Idk how true that is tho
False,1,I have all 15 found lol
False,1,"There are like 15 settlements, make em flourish and let your imagination flow"
False,1,Quest 
False,1,Yeah. Settlements or any questions you can find. Explore places you haven't been. 
False,0,"I was running and shooting one that was following me trying to cripple the legs,and a stupid radstag rammed the suicider 😂😂"
False,2,We already know that it's over when you heard the bip. ^^
False,1,Lol my companion has been through a lot! With my silver shroud outfit on I can hit the dips real quick!
False,2,"Once, I saved when I heard it because it had been a while. I reloaded and tried to get away like 6 times but I did it.

I sacrifice my companion every time."
False,5,GID DMMIT MY LAST SAVE WAS IN... vault 111
False,0,When your crippled or overuncumbered and just gunna walk abit further to get a new location unlocked then bip bip bip.
False,6,I used to be a sole survivor like you then a suicider punched me in the left nipple
False,0,"I actually craft Molotov cocktails whenever I can. 
Plus, I have a full settlement dedicated to farming components needed to make adhesives so I've never really had to worry about it. "
False,0,"Molotov cocktails are a joke, you know that when you first try the mortar grenade. ^^"
False,0,Wa nay

False,0,Love it lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.  Where is this cane u so called talk anout
False,0,Ok 
False,1,"Okay, very good information. ^^"
False,0,It actually attacks who's ever shooting at it 
False,0,Speaking of that deathclaw.    Why does it only attack you?  And not the raiders?   Seems like some serious bull shit to me 
False,2,And stayed during a deathclaw attack... persistence kids. That's the lesson here.
False,0,ATOM HAS SPOKEN
False,0,Nah there just on drugs so they don't know what their doing
False,1,ATOM HAS BEEN ATOMINIZED
False,1,To each their own

False,0,Lame I assumed so. You think they'll get around to fixing it?

False,0,😉
False,0,Looool
False,0,"Wait so you kept trying the same machine over and over and it worked?? 

YEEEE!! THERE IS STILL HOPE!!! Lol"
False,1,"Yeah, I got one. I think it was Pristine Cake or something like that. Took a damn long time though"
False,0,"Still looks pretty damn good for a 210 year old AIDSberry cake lol 
And I don't even know why I want it, it just kind of caught my eye on day one and I've been trying to get one ever since. Haha "
False,0,No I meant aidsberry

False,0,1 cap plz
False,0,Yea sure lemme get some of dat jet
False,0,"Well... Sorry dude, can't really take a joke for the fact that I can't tell if someones really joking or not. I thought you were just insulting me there for a second"
False,0,Any way you wanna buy some jet
False,0,Yes I forget that text can't convey feeling 
False,0,Ur joking?
False,0,"Btws... It sounded rude when you said to me ""ever heard of leveling up"""
False,0,Yes it's pretty good but it would defeat the point of levelling up your strength
False,0,I'm joking
False,0,"You just craft it. To get the biggest bang for your buck, go get the big boy from that weapons dealer at Diamond City. Put the mod on that it shoots like 16 mini nukes."

False,0,No u can't only wit BOS
False,0,"Yeah, I think you can get it. I never tried, though. I have enough power armor as is."
False,0,...ok...
False,0,That help
False,0,Idk
False,0,"That companion trick is very handy. Its got me home with all kinds of heaviness.

"
False,0,"Did you know you can command your companions to pick up things for you even if their inventory is full?  It's a glitch, but you might as well use it while it works."
False,0,Scrap guns and ammo on the go. There's a station in most areas so you can get the gun scrap (if youre going to drop it anyway) and its huge weight reduction (all scrapped junk items are 0.1 lbs - so a fat man becomes 0.5 lbs from 20-30lbs
False,1,"Upgrade the strong back perk, you won't regret it.  You can use AP to run while overencumbered and can still fast travel"
False,0,Lol yeah that generator will help you in the long run. Hook it up to a water purifier and you'll make purified water which you can sell and make more money over time.
False,0,"So they killed the old people. Note to self, don't send mom in future"
False,0,No they were long dead lol it was only mr handys hanging around
False,2,They they kill the old people too?
False,0,Rifleman is a great perk to get if you love using a combat rifle and shot gun.    Just wasting foos!   Idiot savant is also another good one.  Even with max intelligence it activates a lot for me.  
False,1,"Scrapper ain't that bad if you're low on screws and fiber optics. The aqua boy is handy when it comes to taking a short cut swimming in water since the perk give you water breathing and radiation resistance. Wasteland Whisperer, Animal Friend, and Intimidation can be good if you need someone more powerful than the other followers. Gun Nut, Weapon Smith, Armor Smith, and Science! are vital perks that you'll need to help you survive by increasing your offensive and defensive abilities by making your weapons and armor better. Medic is in my opinion vital because health is real important when it comes to radiation and fighting enemies since both can kill you than send you back to your last save"
False,5,All of them. Why not.
False,1,"Yah thats the one, that sucks but I do look like a badass boss at ny settlement "
False,0,You mean the X-01 power armor? Naw I tried that it doesn't work
False,0,"Lol yea it saves you a lot of thinking. I've found enough of them before to narrow it down to 3 words which makes it pretty impossible to get locked out hahah 
Can't believe it took you three fallout games to figure that one out 😆"
False,0,"I know now, can't believe I've gone so long doing it the hard way.  Luckily you can always back out and start over before you get locked out. And now you're only locked out for a short period of time anyways."
False,0,Lol we all jumped on it like fat kids on cake!! 
False,0,You have to look for (/<{[ those symbols only the ones facing in that direction and they connect to the ones after it if you click it it will either remove a dud word or reset your tries. There is only one try reset though and the harder the computer the less dud removes there will be  
False,0,Damn u badman 😂😂😂😂😂😂
False,0,Look for things like this <> or this <¥¥^{]\> n u can click om them in one click.  It usually takes duds away or tries reset
False,0,"Look for things like this (@&,&) or <¥|^{*> or {} or [ ]"
False,0,"Thats great to hear, thank you"
False,0,You can gain health back if you use the little water pumps
False,0,Ah damn. I appreciate it!
False,0,The small pumps give water to your settlers but they don't produce purified water in your workshop
False,0,I'm going to have to try it. But the small pumps- not purifiers. 
False,0,Have* lol
False,0,They do depending on what pump u habe
False,0,Yes they do
False,0,If u want to know mine it's BananaButt29
False,0,Uh huh
False,0,Im 14 but I'm mature. 
False,0,Thats mine.  N theres no s at the end bro.  If ur mature enough if ur over 18 u can add me 
False,0,Loma ^
False,1,Ipoopbags
False,0,Whsh
False,0,He would be dead🔫🔪
False,0,Imagine a Fallout 3 Cat Meat. Imagine this face looking to you and you know that it's not possible. ^^
False,0,"I have found cat meat in the game and can't cook it, is there a way to cook it so I don't get rads ?"
False,0,^^^^^^
False,3,Id kill it. Lol. I hate cats lol
False,0,He'd be cat meat?
False,0,R u over 18 n not a whiney bitch?
False,1,What's in it for me
False,1,Why
False,0,I killed them long before the institute came along by the college square
False,0,They are your neighbors 
False,1,I saw them before I beat the game. They just walk around the commonwealth in a pack. And I also believe they're your neighbors
False,1,I thought I heard somewhere that those were the names of your neighbors before the war
False,0,I didn't know glowing ones could do that.  Probably bc I always try to kill them first whenever I see them
False,0,It's truly a pain in the ass. 
False,0,Yes they can. Look up the glowing one for fallout 4. 
False,0,Oh fuck. 
False,0,Glowing ones can revive dead ghouls 
False,0,No the glowing one. I've only seen it done twice. 
False,0,Who revived the ghouls? Macready?
False,0,It'd* smh autocorrect 
False,3,"We don't care 🤗

Although it's be nice to get rid of people like you who just want attention, I highly doubt you'd delete the app. "
False,2,And what if I don't like ? ^^
False,0,"Strait up, that place is dope "
False,0,Sanctuary and the castle are my two favorites. Sunshine tidings has a lot of people and space but hard to defend
False,0,Been trying to find somewhere in city but hangmans alley is the only one I found so far and I love it
False,0,Muahahahaha long live the brotherhood 
False,0,"I use Croup Manor, an easy to protect house with walls that is easy to place to protect. Crazy fawking kids keep causing a ruckus since i'm the BoS's next door neighbor but I still like the Croup Manor"
False,0,"Ah, didn't think of that "
False,0,I fixed the walls. 
False,0,You can just put walls over them. Or use the concrete floors
False,0,"The castle had tons of entrances, remember parts of the walls have been demolished "
False,0,I love the castle ... Only one entrance and many many turrets. 
False,0,Sure
False,0,Nice.  Thanks. Ill hit ya up when i get ob fir a fallout party.  Gotta waut a bit tho till after 430 central time

False,1,"Liquid force

Why: used to like?? You didnt have to kill him"
False,1,"SPOILER














I used to love Paladin Danse.😢"
False,0,Codsworth in my opinion he suits my play style and supports all my decisions lol and  the others are kinda bitches always getting knocked down. Plus he looks funny in the bowler hat. 
False,1,Lily is an amazing companion 👏🏻😄
False,0,They all have special perks but I like Nick Valentine. He's great for hacking terminals.
False,2,"Guy claims he hates whiny 10 year olds.

Proceeds to whine like a 10 year old bitch on fallout 4 discussions.

Sorry, I couldn't help myself."
False,1,Maybe you're the bitch...
False,2,Than how 'bout you leave her if you fucking hate her so much? You obviously aren't happy about it.
False,0,Rad not rd
False,0,Culd be.  Maybe a rd storm hit us lol
False,1,Sounds like you're not happy. Maybe the relationship is toxic.
False,0,U have no idea cayde.  U really dnt.  SO NO IM NOT GONNA CALM DOWN. The bitch been lying to me for 8 years n cheated on my or tried to emotionally for 4 n 1/2 years.  So fuck tha CUNT.

False,0,About 10 or 11... Million
False,0,140ish
False,0,I have about 200. I should use power armor more.
False,0,I keep a steady thirty 
False,0,57
False,0,130 just got lucky 
False,0,Hahaha i Also have like 40 from scavenging.
False,0,Only have 20 left but that's enough to explore in OP armor for dayyys
False,0,35 and I've never bought or stolen any that's pure scaving 
False,0,I have like 46
False,0,The graphics weren't that great to begin with so doubt you would notice a difference. I know I didn't :p still an awesome game though as are all the fallouts. Will admit I expected slightly more with the current gen consoles though. 
False,0,I looked up what they did in the patch after starting up Fallout 4 to be presented with the update. I dont really care if graphics get a slight decrease
False,0,I didn't even know they did that
False,0,"Ok good. Many people get really pissed when games do that, but i never notice it. Its the same thing that happened with The Witcher 3"
False,0,Not at all.
False,0,Suicide 
False,0,One simply does not
False,0,You could be like me an upon reading about this mole rat disease I thought it was what Virgil had. So I refused to give him the antidote and just shot him instead. Was only after I realized it was a completely different quest. Whoops. 
False,0," -_- had I known It was me or him, I'd have used it on me"
False,1,I accidentally killed them all in vault 81 after I did that quest even though I gave the kid his cure
False,0,Only one cure in the game and u have to choose to use it on urself or Austin. I chose Austin and it's only a -10 hit to your HP
False,0,There is a quest at Vault 81  after saving Ashes and coming back later you can get the cure and use it on yourself ir the boy. They all hate you if you use it on yourself 
False,0,Or a chiuauia
False,2,Or a pitbull
False,1,I can't find the brightness option on console wtf?
False,1,Codsworth is referring to lack of lightbulbs me thinks! 😁
False,2,"""'I find this level of darkness completely unnecessary"" - codsworth"
False,0,Hense why we need darker nights! 😢 wonder if any other geniuses got any better ideas! 
False,0,No I don't see anything for brightness in any settings menu
False,0,I'm sorry baby
False,0,"Yeah but then eveything becomes darker, not just the sky, before you post stupid shit man, thimk about it.. simply turning brightness down doesnt fix the problem, you sarcy lil scrub."
False,0,Xxxx
False,0,"The ""settings"" dumbass"
False,0,Lol can you change brightness level after you start game?  If so how?
False,3,"Danse nearly came every time I got into my power armor, worked on it, or even looked at it. "
False,0,Just danse 
False,0,Was it stolen 
False,0,Wait what?
False,0,I didn't read the question. I thought you dismissed Dogmeat after Hancock died and couldn't find him
False,0,Maybe. 
False,1,"I'll never forget the picture of Hancocks legs and upper body laying in the buld head of the Prydwen, next to the pile of ashes of Maxson :b actually, after thinking about it, l set up a nuke mine for Maxson, could it be that Hancock was blown apart because of me 🙊?"
False,2,He's with ghoul Jesus now. 
False,0,I sent him to The Castle and took his coat so he's naked
False,0,"Hancock was the best companion I had, he was the only one that never was in My way, and alway supported me during hard dialogues :b I didnt mind that his perk isnt as handy as others, he was just an awesome partner during my journey 😊"
False,0,"Thx, didnt think about the bell yet, guess I'll give that a try :) "
False,1,Yeah. He never showed up. I still have his stuff its packed away like a memorial basically. 
False,0,Oh ok :( but did you have to send him to a settlement after you chose another companion? 
False,0,Kate. He killed Hancock. 
False,0,If you have your Xbox set up to a constant internet connection it will do it automatically when you turn it on 
False,1,They by default update automatically
False,1,Depends on ur settings but I do know mine updated automatically 
False,0,Lol yeah I let those gorillas out too. They were pretty effective at killing those guys.
False,0,Hell no
False,1,I let the synth gorillas destroy those bitch ass protesters who locked themselves in
False,6,Death you shall have
False,0,Dogmeat can carry 130 which isnt bad!

False,0,I just shot him. But he understood the meaning of his death and he took it. 
False,0,"Ik that point, I manage to persuade Elder Maxon to letting him live. He told Danse that hes banned from the Prydemn (or whatever way their ship is spelled) and is not allowed to talk to anyone from the BoS"
False,1,"When I had to kill danse it was heart breaking, but he went out with honor. He with out like a Paladin. "

I'm in January I think and I am at level 33. But I happened to conveniently travel back to diamond city the morning of Christmas and it was awesome.
False,0,Lol.  I know everyone was talking about it the other day bout how cool diamond city looked for christmas.  I found a random tree tho for christmas n it had the head of a raider on it as a topper lol

False,0,"I'm sure the new battlefront is fun, but no campaign and only 2 more maps than the beta?? That's not worth 60 bucks to me. Especially if they want me to shell out another 50 for a dlc that should have been included in the full game. "

False,0,Sanctuary.
False,0,Fallout education just kicked you in the teeth!😠
False,0,"When dealing with large settlements like Castle, Sanctuary, or the Drive In it is not at all convenient to highlight the settler to see where they are assigned.  Many posts, such as guard posts, are spread out, and making everything do that is in the line of sight of the bell is not reasonable.  That is not designing a ""better settlement,"" that is letting one game mechanic dictate where you place everything.  This game is awesome because you can design the settlements however you want.  You may like putting everything together in a central location, I like laying things out in sections and do not mind doing things like putting buildings between jobs.  It seems more reasonable, in a game that thrives on personalization, to put a little caption beneath a person's name or description (settler) that says employed or unemployed than to expect us to design our settlements in limited ways and then still have to ring a bell, wait for all the settlers to arive, and then sort through 20 settlers in build mode looking for a little green highlight and hoping it is not covered by all the other settlers or that I do not lose track of who I checked already.
For the second point, I know you can just dump stuff in the workbench, and that, contrary to most early information, if the bench scraps something for you it automatically stores the leftover parts (I personally verified this a while ago because of contradictory info).  The problem is that when there is a lot of stuff to transfer back to a central supply hub the components weigh a fraction of what the ""junk"" weighs.  Also, it is easier to keep track of what supplies you have after they are scrapped.  Again, this is not game beaking, but how hard would it be to add a ""scrap all junk"" button next to the ""store all junk"" button?
You want me to really whine and complain I could add a #3 and ask why there is no option to cancell supply lines from the supply line view on the map instead of having to catch the person on the supply line after a fast travel, assign them to something else, and then hope that it is the right supply line?  If I started over from scratch it would be easier, but trying to reorganize supply lines after you have over a dozen settlements is a real pain.
Finally, I am not annoyed with thes e things because I do not understand the mechanics or have not played enough.  I am annoyed because these are the things that stand out to me after dozens of hours of play as things that would streamline the game and get rid of needless ""busywork"" simply by adding a couple of menu items.  Also, I am not really bitching, I love this game.  These are just a few things that I think could make it better without sacrificing anything at all in return. :)"
False,0,Yeah definitely need to build better settlements. Put some time into your electric grid. Run wires. Make jobs easy to find and bunched together. It would be nice to be able to assign characters to beds and buildings ect. It would be an awesome improvement to be able to set characters up like fallout Shelter. Make families and kids in the settlements. Build schools and assign teachers. Now I'm ranting. Fallout 
False,0,*Titanic music playing while this guy cries about things he doesn't understand.
False,0,Build your settlement better 
False,1,"As I see what you're saying ^ I'll also have to disagree. Sometimes your settlement is too big to see where they're assigned to. Other structures get in the way. It would be better if they made it where you can get into your workshop, highlight your settler, and it have a caption saying where they work along with the outline of their job's position. "
False,0,"Bro I think you should play the game a bit more before you whine about it. To see what your setters are assigned to 1. Build a bell 2. Ring it 3. Enter workbench mode 4. Look at all your settlers (who have assembled from you ringing the bell) and each of their jobs will be highlighted green when you run your cursor over the settler. And your second point doesn't make sense, all of your junk is saved when you hit ""store junk"" or ""scrap""."
False,1,"It does tell you what a settler is assigned to, when you enter workshop mode and highlight a settler it will highlight what they are assigned to.

But this system could be better "
False,0,no you can scrap apparel at the armor workstation
False,0,"You still have to drop and scrap apparel for leather. Should be able to scrap it at the work bench.

No sympathy for people complaining that game breaking exploits are gone though."
False,0,You have a child yet you're getting butthurt at someone on the internet that you don't know? That poor kid.
False,0,I say leave him alone. Is he annoying. Yes. But compared to some people on here he isn't terrible. Let's not alienate him. He'll just become worse.
False,1,U might make a new one but your comments are easy to spot lol
False,0,I knew you would say something stupid like that lol
False,0,Oh ok
False,0,That's my son Anthony in my pic
False,2,Yea I hate people like him everyone like this to get him banned( even thought it takes 10 seconds to create a new account😐)
False,0,Let's treat this like a petition to make him gtfo lol
False,0,Why is there a child in your profile picture is it yours or a random picture you pulled off the web.... Or is it you...?
False,0,Lol same
False,0,Same haha
False,0,Did you mean: 1 day
False,0,Ha 
False,3,Fallout 4 is like the radiations. This game destroy us slowly.
False,0,Im telling dad
False,0,"It doesn't change stats on he stays screen but your armor can still take 4x the hits before breaking, anyone know if there is another legendary arm, that's all I have left to complete my legendary set, xo1 is good but a full set would be nice"
False,1,"There is the Pizonucleic armor which you get in the Cambridge Polymer Lab,it's level dependant"
False,1,"Thanks SSJ, I couldn't remember. Also, it didn't change any stats for me either but I don't have to repair nearly as often "
False,2,I think there's a piece by finishing a experiment in a lab somewhere downtown. It's a side quest. I think it's a torso piece that takes less radiation.
False,2,"Yeah i got that too. Haven't used it yet.
Is there any other legendary power armour??"
False,3,It's on a Gunner in Quincy.
False,1,I got it too but when I put it on my armor it didn't show the health on the pieces quadruple. Did it for you??
False,2,"Maybe one day when I aquire a disposable income, I will purchase said vault suit for my loyal Companion because he deserves the best."
False,2,I know its outrageously badass though.

False,0,He even has the captain hat on still
False,0,Bloody auto correct its veribird
False,0,"you dont need to start a new game lol.

im nearly finished and i've never been to the castle after the quest. just grab all of your materials and relocate? "
False,0,Why would Nick care about the big dig quest?
False,0,"I didn't like my skill tree anyway, the game only takes about a week to beat"
False,0,New game I guess he won't leave the castle :(
False,0,"He is trying to kill me, it's not that I am worried he has shit guns and I have x-01, I am worried about my settlement of 17 people though, the Minutemen won't attack me but the settlers will"
False,1,Its not broken you just get to play without him. Lol
False,2,I am so pissed I had beat the game and nick won't die!
False,2,Thats a tough one man. Could possibly lure him away and put your gun away. Sometimes works. But I'm clutching at straws for you pal. Not a clue.
False,0,None of them 
False,0,Curie... Like hot damn her freaking accent makes me melt
False,1,Cait ❤ 
False,1,Pipers hot! But Caits a freak haha
False,0,C.I.T Ruins buddy not Diamond City

False,0,I played through twice with both endings and railroad is my favorite.
False,0,"The Brotherood are hungry from power, we know that. ^^"
False,1,Ok
False,0,"Well you can join minutemen and brotherhood, and minutemen and railroad"
False,0,It be funny if i joined those 3
False,0,"Well there is brotherhood they hate the instute railroad hates them too minutemen dont really care brotherhood trying to save the Commonwealth, railroad just cares about free syths, minutemen want a free and prosperous wastland"
False,0,No just started 'cause i got a suggestion
False,0,What 3 factions should i join
False,0,"Np also join the brotherhood they will give you lots of caps and stuff, by the way are you a old player of the games?"
False,0,Thanx for the tip. I already know a lot about fallout 4

False,0,Agreed
False,1,He would be a awsome mascot for vault-tec
False,1,"I have a 14 year old wiener dog that would not help in an actual ""fallout"" but I love her lol"
False,0,I don't have a dog don't rub it in :(
False,0,Yup
False,0,I'd love it more if u could have a like one of those giant domestic cats as a companion. I forgot what they're called their badass though and could have some cool sneak attack abilities.
False,1,"I have a cat, so yes, I love my dog. :D"
False,0,If it's the actual bar on the screen that says size then that's just max of stuff u can build 
False,0,"The way they have it is u automatically can have 10 people. And u can have more the higher the charisma so lol 2 charisma is +2 settlers. So the max is 20. U can increase it further with certain cloths. 

A recruitment beacon helps also 

Hope that helps "
False,0,"Also, build stuff people like. I.e. a clinic, bar. But some times it is just slow at some places and fast at others."
False,0,You need to build more and increase population.
False,1,Cool
False,2,"Idk. I'm thinking people will need to mod on PC and bring it over somehow. As Frieza as the mods themselves, I think yhey just want to avoid mods that will ""break"" the game. If the codes of two mods clash, your game could get fucked. As far as applying the mods.... I think they said it'll be very easy. You'll get like a list, I'm guessing at the main menu, and you'll get to pick and chose the ones you want. Then, just start playing."
False,0,"Here you go

False,0,"Sure, give me a bit to find it "
False,0,Post it
False,0,"Is a radiant quest, so it might become repeatable, but only happened to me once so far..."
False,0,That's pretty badass! Hahah so is that a one time thing or will there always be a random chance of it happening? 
False,1,I once killed a settler (just saved and went on a rampage) and found components. So i reloaded to my normal game and shot the guy. I guess there are no investigations in the game bc Preston grabbed my power armor and destroyed me even though he was secretly I synth. I make that synth my bitch now.
False,0,Yes!!!! There's a guest to find the infiltrated synth in your settlements! Apparently you found it before even the quest started! Congrats
False,0,"That's actually pretty awesome. Adds to the game, I think."

False,1,I need a Kate shaw here
False,1,At some settlement i thin but i choosen institute and next time put [SPOILER] because some hevnt finshed the game yet
False,0,"Idk,I think you can't. Try the Xbox app if you have win 10"
False,0,"I wanted to just, no questions asked, go on a rampage through the institute, but killing him blocked all exits :("
False,2,"It was out of rage and undisciplined emotion that I took his life after seeing my ""son"" modded out like an abomination."
False,2,Shoot first ask questions later is the moral of this sad story.
False,2,"Same, wanted to see what would happen"

False,0,My. God...
False,2,Blame Doctor Li
False,1,Yeah I dumped him he's too judgie for me. Went back and got codsworth we seem to agree on everything 
False,2,I'm melee and i wanted his perk so bad but he's too difficult. He's at my settlement hating every time I get in power armor just to move it around. Can't ever win with this guy
False,2,"If you don't use melee I don't see the point in gaining affinity with strong, unless you are trying to get all the companions perks."
False,2,Yeah he's kind of a tweek. He doesn't like it when you pick locks or wear Power Armor. The best thing he's good for is carrying junk. Which is the only reason I wear power armor.
False,1,"I run with dog meat. He doesn't care what U do, is useful and u can use the lone wonderer perk even having dog meat "

I then ran out of resources again -_- shit got a bit bigger then the blueprints :p "
False,0,After I do that I like to make a settlement all to myself super fun
False,0,Yep! Get one strong enough to survive on its own then off to the next!
False,0,"I love doing that, and you can do it so much plus when you are done with makeing a super OP settlement you can move to another and do it all over"
False,0,I think they're gonna throw in a new aliens dlc 
False,0,"Well, I bear that the reason there's a harpoon gun file and some many dead mutated sharks/dolphins is because there was suppose to be a underwater side quest. Since they did so much work on it already, I'm guessing there just going to finish that. Besides that, since Bethesda said that they were going to listen to the community, I'm guessing something to do with the capital wasteland. Whether we are going to go back, or someone from the Capital Wasteland is going to come here is anyone's guess. 

With teleportation and memory dens, anything is possible."
False,0,That's a lie
False,0,yep
False,0,Dog meat glitch?!?! Please inform me. I need tons more caps to get what I'm trying to get.
False,0,"Its a solo game.
People are such pu**ies."
False,0,"I just don't understand why anyone cares, it is a single player game.  If you think cheating is bad, don't cheat.  Should they patch the ultimate cheat. . . Easy mode?"
False,0,Before yall hate on me I have a lvl 60 no glitch character and a lvl 65 every glitch possible lol
False,0,"I've been doing a glitch with reactor coolant I make 50 duplicate with dogmeat menu glitch till I'm at 500 and get like 60,000 caps "

False,0,People should be able to play however they want. Pursuit of happiness man it's different for everyone.  
False,0,The duping glitch is not patched
False,2,Yes because they patched it it doesn't mean it's fixed because if I really wanted to do the glitch I just won't download the patch . But it's a single player game I don't mind being offline on my console . I do not understand why people want you to have the same experience as them. I will alway find a way to be Op and rich in games  no matter what

False,0,And a normal shotgun does around 17x more damage per hit vs. a normal minigun. 
False,0,I have a wounding minihun and it rips everytging go sherds in seconds due to the bleeding getting faster per hits given

False,0,I thought their was a deeper system to it my bad.
False,0,OK. Im assuming you have to harvest it and its only purpose is to use to plant more crops?
False,0,"I don't get what you're asking besides how you get your food and the distribution part but, your food will go into your work bench automatically and settlers only starve when your food is at zero"

False,0,"Ah, thanks. Like I said, I don't know the exact number. I just make sure my Food is at a higher count than Settlers"
False,0,It's six per settler not twelve
False,0,"No, you can only have 20 settlers at one settlement at a time. Once you assign a settler to a plant, they seem to automatically take on the responsibility of the kind of plant that you assigned them to. So if you planted 12 corn, they should take care of those 12 corn and leave your other kinds of plants alone."
False,0,"Do I have to individually hit every plant with ""command""?"

False,1,"They are all Children of Atom, and they are immediately hostile on sight. They use Gamma guns (Radiation guns) so be sure you are stocked up on Rad X and RadAway, bring power armour if you can.

They are easy enough to kill, just bring a good gun and you're sorted. 

(NOTE: There is also a lighthouse just ahead of the crater. That also has Children Of Atom occupants, and a Glowing One in the lighthouse tower.)

False,0,Kyle what are modkits 
False,0,"@The wanderer
A ton of games and movie series's do that. It's so that they can put out more content that isn't better enough, compared to the newest game, to be considered one of the ""main series."" New Vegas for example, it's mostly the same as 3 but with a bit of crafting and some mods you can buy for weapons. That's about it. "
False,0,Tactics and brotherhood of steel are the same
False,0,Fallout 4 is technically fallout 7 with fallout 1 2 3 and new Vegas tactics and brotherhood of steel just saying 
False,1,He's got a point though. Mod kits will be awesome too. Probably enough extras from DLC and mods to make a whole new game anyways 
False,0,I know but I still can't wait 
False,0,God damn it thumbs
False,2,DLC* came*^
False,2,Doc hasn't even can out yet
False,0,"New Vegas had better gameplay, Fallout 3 had better story"
False,0,Fallout 3 if you like more urban setting/ story is mostly focused on you. Fallout new Vegas if you like that cowboy/western feel and want to get into the politics of reshaping the Mohave. Both are great in my opinion.
False,0,Awful opinions HOOOOOOOO
False,0,I kinda like 3 better
False,0,3 was my fav
False,0,3 had better DLC

False,0,"You don't have to do the memory den quest to start hers.  Btw, he's referibg to a main story mission. After you find Nick Valentine join to a quest with him and you end up at the memory den in good neighbor"
False,0,Go to her wikia page. It has her list of looks and dislikes
False,0,Oh ok i just stole from the major and she didnt like that:(
False,0,I just kept her as a companion for a bit. She likes it when you're nice to people. She eventually just asked if she could talk to me and then I agreed to help her find a doctor that could help her.

Me: oh shit. *drops controller to await inevitable death* 
Behemoth runs past and attacks death claw (actually saving my sorry ass). I repaid the help in shot gun blasts "
False,0,First time in Lexington (like lvl 6) and ~20 ghouls come out of nowhere and run me down. It was like out of 28 days later.  Did not expect that and ran like a little girl. Cheap play style note - they can't get you on top of a car. They swarm for a minute then run a way and hide. Kinda cheap/lame but better than dying.

False,0,I am also on Xbox one 
False,0,My bar is completely empty and I still get materials so I don't know if its something wrong with your game

False,0,"You can kill Mama Murphy?! What sick bastard made that possible,her dialogue is priceless"
False,0,"My settlers don't die unless I shoot them. For some reason they're set to essential when enemies attack, so when they lose their health they just sit there for awhile. But as soon as my bullet hits them they die. It does the same for Caravan Guards and travelling Merchants. "
False,0,nah I don't think she carries anything
False,0,Will I get anything out of mama Murphy before I decide to blow the crusty old meth slags brains out ? 
False,0,yeah settlers can die but the ones with names like sturges can't die. except mama Murphy. you can kill her 
False,0,Do a hard restart on your Xbox. Unplug is for about a minute then plug it back in
False,0,"Uninstalling the game SHOUlD NOT make you lose all of your progress if all of your game saves are linked to your hard drive, or another external storage device that can use your saves for you console.

False,1,What question?
False,1,And you never answered my question 
False,1,Sure
False,0,"Haha checkout my first encounter if you feel like it.

EvilSaintDyl "
False,0,Yea i do 
False,0,PS4 for the win
False,0,Tbf mr whitey is right. I had the Xbox one first and traded it in for the ps4.
False,0,Meeee!

False,0,"It just makes you think ""what a wonderful day in the commonwealth"""
False,0,I like to drag them into my special sex dungeon I built. Then once the door is shut I do unspeakable things to them. 
False,0,Put some long John's on them and toss them a pillow and teddy bear
False,0,"It would be great if they updated the workshop.. Imagine  putting dead bodies for display around your settlements! Like raiders 

...I need more rope and spikes XD "
False,1,Tell dogmeat to eat em'
False,1,Embrace the fact you have dead people around because it tells you you are stronger than them.
False,2,I think this teaches the settlers not to fucking mess around with me. Or they will receive the same fate. I should hang paladin danse on a pike in the front gate. 👹
False,2,Would be cool if u could scrap them!
False,1,You can mutilate them and if they respawn (like on the end of the bridge at sanctuary) it will only be a torso...
False,0,Haha guess I have to try a bit of everything XD thanks for the help 
False,0,I misread that as Varia Suit...
False,0,Vault suit
False,0,Same 
False,0,Nah ive always used power armor 
False,0,You ever do it? 
False,0,Idk that's what I read
False,1,I got my ass whooped while wearing it. 
False,0,My dick
False,0,Yea after the quest for it it's great
False,0,What? 
False,0,"I have that. I also have a lvl 35 character and I still don't see many spawn. I mean I'm rich enough I can always buy, but vendors usually don't have a stockpile"
False,0,Get the perk that makes more ammo spawn
False,0,The ashmaker is shit if you ask me 
False,0,"You could just level up more so missiles and such spawn. Ya know like there's that too ._.

Instead of making more characters. "
False,1,I found out spray and pray does gain a bonus from demolitions perk. But do I want to use that or ashmaker????
False,0,Beast mode 
False,0,I got 6000 caps from purified water 👍
False,0,Gdmn 
False,0,Everyone is so salty today! 
False,0,"Lol ""for people who suck at fallout""

I guess people who increase the size limit of their settlements are shit too? 
People who exploit the water purification scheme for essentially unlimited caps? 
I guess this guy didn't use the ammo cheat what so ever. 

Makes me laugh! Go whine about how people play solo games eleswhere please. ThankYou "
False,0,^^ lol I meant bf not bed
False,0,yeah but some people use it on the SPECIAL books in the beginning so they can get all of them to 10
False,1,Yeah I'm collecting my eater right now. I'll let you know how much I make in caps.
False,0,it's really hard because of the timing but my bed got the handle of it so I make him do it 😌
False,0,Thats actually pretty smart

False,0,You're funny actually. Sanctuary is in a Behemoth's asshole
False,0,Where is that? 
False,0,By vault 111
False,0,Where the fuck is sanctuary?
False,0,Robot mr handy from sanctuary
False,0,Saaame @kateshaw
False,0,I agree calm the hell down 
False,0,"Here's the site Joe, go behind the Railroad HQ all the way to the coast where you'll see a crashed Vertibird. Next to it is a cage locked with an advanced terminal in it is a full T51,and I agree it's my favourite suit too"
False,0,I really like the T-45 but I prefer the T-60 because it is symetric.
False,0,"I'm using the T-60 the most right now, actually. It's probably my second favorite now."
False,0,Not funny
False,0,"LOL SUCK FOR YOU FAGGOT

False,1,I like the T-60 myself
False,0,What the fuck is a cutscence?
False,0,They all have the cutscence
False,0,OH SHIT HE SAID IT
False,0,You wish
False,0,My dick
False,0,Damn..I missed out on a lot then since I didn't do many missions for any of ghe factions except for minute men..but surely that can't mean I miss out on over 40 locations but at the same time I have literally walked every edge and everywhere in between and I'm not seeing anywhere I don't have...strange..Thanks for all the input guys much more useful than trawling the internet looking for answers. 
False,0,"Yea , i kinda figured that . I think i have all those location , but i could be wrong ."
False,0,Fallout4map.com
False,0,344 is highest number I've seen. But apparently some placed are only accessible through missions
False,0,"All i can confirm is that i have 338 discovered locations , I've been looking all week but can't seem to find anymore. "
False,0,Thanks man ^^ just fast travelling around hoping to see something...it's getting pretty tough ._. Lol
False,0,Go to glowing sea I think 9 locations are past the borderline and the ship uss constitution is actually 2 locations in 1 if u do the quest and side with ironside 
False,0,Niiice ^^ gives me hope to find more but honestly I must be walking straight past these 20 locations..
False,0,I have 320 right now but heard 340-361 so idk its bullshit 
False,1,"Haha well then explore, lvl up and find cool stuff and one day those muties will be scared of you :)...in fact no I can't say that those guys ain't scared of shit they run at you with nukes..but none the less..embrace the unkown x) "
False,0,"LOL

False,0,Not funny
False,1,About to say.... Lol
False,1,"NO YOU FUCKING FUMBASS

False,1,Not until early 2016

False,0,Bunker Hill 
False,1,Why should I follow you on xbox one?
False,2,Just make nothing but stores in a settlement or two and trade with those 
False,2,"Gray garden, vault 81"
False,0,They're the only major cities
False,0,I don't have android
False,0,You don't need jailbreak or computer
False,0,It's the only package
False,0,Jailbreak and thus source: http://system.in-appstore.com/repo
False,0,Tell me 
False,0,I know a hack to get 1000 lunch boxes only android though
False,0,Gosh darn
False,0,What they said 
False,0,Thanks good to know
False,1,Beat you to it lol
False,1,Coming early 2016
False,2,Will be in 2016
False,0,How good are you with Interplay/Black Isle lore?
False,0,Okey doke
False,0,They were a peaceful tribe killed by the White Legs
False,0,"This is kinda dead, I'm gonna do a Q&A see ya there"
False,0,Oh and tar walkers are a tribe in utah. Peaceful. 
False,0,NCR is spread way to thin. Holding to much in a little hand. 
False,0,Kimball blows but the Legion are sexist slavers. 
False,0,A tribe Caesar conquered probably 
False,0,Who were the Tar Walkers?
False,0,"NCR is garbage under Kimball, Caesar is mighty"
False,0,Yup ikr
False,0,That's peculiar
False,0,Post not pist * lol. 
False,0,No i was in it trying to send that last message on ur pist n bam i gott sign in 
False,1,Not sure. Did it just close temporarily?
False,3,Put the quantum harmonizer in the photonic resonating chamber
False,0,Uh this isn't a porno you know?
False,0,"You should have said you were gay. They'd love you for it. If you're gonna be abnormal, be gay. Then you'll be ""brave"" instead of ""disgusting"" and not have to be embarrassed."
False,0,What has happened to humanity?
False,0,That's disgusting. 
False,1,Oh...I have no comment except that I'm embarrassed for you
False,0,"A Weeaboo, Kate Shaw,  is an American or other nationality that is not Japanese, but is over the top about Japanese culture and anime, sometikes they even wish they were Japanese or living in Japan"
False,0,What's that?
False,0,Eww
False,0,I actually think that might work xD
False,0,I wonder if I can throw a homing beacon onto his submarine...
False,0,Actually it does run background just at a much slower rate 
False,0,"If you close the app it won't run in the background, just close it while your away"
False,0,Yeah they run out of food cause I'm not collecting cause I'm doing somthing then they get radiation 
False,0,Not enough food as well
False,0,Build more purifiers and assign people there
False,0,"You can close the app and it won't do anything, if they don't have enough water, they'll drink bad water and get radiated"
False,0,Loot!
False,2,Uhh decorations? 
False,1,Scrap 
False,0,Get the Blitz perk (9 agility).  It's insane.
False,0,I just take out the people further north doing that to save space instead of taking as much armor or any weapons. 
False,0,I don't have any of the melee perk or blunt weapons perk and I easily take out a group of raiders with my bare hands 😂
False,0,I hope they don't ever
False,0,God I hope not. I didn't think it was. But I didn't get around to down loading it yet 
False,0,"Thank fuck, saw people on here saying it had been patched 😔"
False,0,"The size one isn't patched, I think just the vendor caps glitch"
False,0,They did? Oh fucking shitttt
False,0,"You can do that trick where you out a bunch of useless guns into the work bench, grab them again, drop them, and scrap them unless it got patched."
False,0,Or*
False,0,Ahhh this patch I'm hearing about...has it just done away with mods of something? Doesn't sound very Bethesda to me.
False,0,Yeah size. Heard they patched the weapon scrapping glitch
False,0,Unless there's something I've totally missed there are mods on pc to increase settlement size but can't do that on console until mods cross over to those as well. 
False,0,Build a doghouse at your settlement he will go to it if you get separated
False,0,Thanks!
False,1,That happened on my recent play through. Got to sanctuary if that's where you had him last and check the dog houses. 
False,0,He will be at red rocket truck stop if you picked up another companion and didn't specify where you want dogmeat to go 
False,0,If you just got Nick he'll be at a settlement
False,1,He probably went back to the place you had him at last if he wasn't your companion 
False,0,"He'll prob be outside when its done, if not check Sanctuary "
False,0,"You know,I did abot 10-15 New Vegas playthroughs and I didn't side with the Legion in a single one,I know what to do after I play the hell out of 4"
False,0,Very shortly
False,0,I let them kill me the first time so I know how long it would take for me to die
False,0,"""Look its the harmless atom cult...what is that in thier hands....WHY DID I JUST TAKE RADS!?"" yeah. "
False,0,Exactly. 
False,0,I know right I was like ooooo atom people then they start shooting at me so I murdered and mutilated them all
False,1,BoS out ranks the Railroad. 
False,0,"I'm going to play through as all the factions though. I'm curious to see every possible outlet. 

Fuck you Bethesda. "
False,1,Yeah. Someone must die. It's kinda bullshit. Especially when you take down the Institute and one other group. I don't mind the Institute (kinda a hard pill to swallow) but still can't decide between the railroad and BoS. 
False,2,I never got why the hell the church was so damn violent in this game. They were passive in 3. 
False,0,Lol... North Korea tries to bomb the US... the international equivalent of suicide by cop.
False,0,Lol
False,0,Someone had to do it eventually 
False,1,"Because War,War never changes"
False,0,Yes because taking more stuff over would help. The Romans did that and it worked out well. So did the Athenian actually
False,0,Let me see your man boobs and maybe I'll like you America 
False,0,Damn strait👆🏻👆🏻
False,1,"Really in all actuality America should have never stopped taking shit over. We started as 13 colonies, in which We took, and then we went to war or bought the rest. We should have kept going a little bit more, and maintained the we are the biggest and baddest attitude, while enforcing it. I doubt we'd have so many problems Now. Now we are just viewed as spoiled, lazy, slobs and everyone just walks on us while the government practically begs for people to like us. We don't need anyone. What we need to do is start flexing our military power and tell people to chill before we got problems "
False,0,Lol
False,1,I hope vault tec doesn't happen 
False,0,"Who says dweebs anymore?
"
False,0,https://media.giphy.com/media/r35VO5DnOV8ty/giphy.gif
False,0,Admiral Ackbar: Its a Trap!
False,0,I knew this wasn't real
False,1,See if stealth replies to my post lol
False,1,It's cool man. I get it. You just wanted to see people's reaction or some shit. I understand you're no stealth suit or anything. But it still was a troll like action. 
False,2,Guys chill cayd said it was a social experiment 
False,1,No he sais stealth suit. The dude who said hed delete the app at 40 arrows
False,1,I thought it was funny how he thought the guy was trying to say douche
False,1,@SSJ I'm a douche? I called you a dweeb as a joke I'm sorry it hit you where it hurt lol
False,1,Fallout 4 says any button
False,0,Ah that's right
False,0,Thats how they get ya lol.  N my headsets not working right bro. So i cant party yet 
False,2,Everytime! 😂
False,0,Nick and Piper alpso Preston... And Danse have multiple quests
False,1,Maccready had me do two quests. Find cure for his kid and kill some gunners
False,0,Name* lol
False,1,Well here's the secret..my nane on here is my gamertag on xbox lol Cyphus S
False,0,"First play through I only used dogmeat, noe second play through just using them for their missions..After that I'll leave them be..better for stealth when you don't have them with you having to tell them to wait etc does get annoying."
False,0,Chill cayd 
False,0,"Now that I have the Lone Wanderer perk, companions just screw me"
False,0,I don't use companions anymore.^^
False,0,No you dimwit
False,1,Hey cyphus you have an Xbox? What's your gt 
False,0,Play Danse Danse Revolution
False,0,Woah Cayd
False,0,Never you dimwit
False,0,South of Lexington you'll pick up a military frequency listen to it and follow the quest
False,0,Fuck with nick 
False,0,I don't know that you have to do any specific quest. I was just wandering and picked up the radio signal. It's Cambridge police station tho 
False,0,It's cool. Me and her got it covered. 
False,0,My bad lol
False,0,Would have helped. 
False,0,Oh maybe I should have been more specific 
False,0,"My best Legendary is my Explosive Combat Shotgun. It's retardedly broken.

It's a cool feature, but I hate how there's no consistency to who drops what, so you could get an excellent Legendary from a Roach and a shit one from a Deathclaw.

I also have a million pieces of Legendary Leather Armor, but I'm not Level 2 so they're useless."
False,0,"It's awesome that feature with the legendarys , it gives you the chance to get some damn good weapons , and a good reason not to stop playing , just keep playing until you got the right effect on your favorite weapon , I already got hundreds of them , just play on very hard (I don't like survival mode much) and keep on playing and leveling , in higher levels you get a lot good weapons and armor "
False,0,I've gitten oretty lucky I guess. I got a legendary super sledge. I forget its power tho. But I also fully upgraded it.
False,0,So are ok. I like them cause they are worth more and u can find decent ones. I found a .38 pipe pistol that has explosive rounds and does about as good as my .45 combat rifle 
False,1,"I'm not very lucky with legendaries...

3 legendary baseball bats
legendary knuckles
legendary combat knife
legendary rolling pin
legendary wrench
legendary walking cane

+ they're just the ones i remember 😂"
False,0,Ya i fought a legendary mole rat mother on survival and lost like no health xD (i know its a mole rat but still) 
False,0,Yeah. It's all about the luck of the drop.
False,0,"Killed a legendary deathclaw and I got a rolling pin, later two other legendaries dropped a pool cue and a baton"
False,1,Just another collect able for me. I liked the concept though
False,0,"Yes and no. It's kinds a cool add on. But then again, they seem to only drop pointless shit...

"
False,0,"I hate myself for failing his last speech check, now he's still just holed up in his bunker"
False,0,He is a total beast when fighting the institute in the last mission 
False,0,I agree with that too. 
False,0,Nah he's too crazy for me
False,0,He's old. Would get in the way if anything. 
False,0,It doesn't make sense that you should contract it just because your companion is hit. I wasn't hit at all and still contracted it. Lame ass followers. >_<
False,3,I don't want aids I can't bang piper anymore because I have fallout aids how would you feel when no one can touch you
False,1,OH.. Well I'm still going to massacre those fuckers just for fun...
False,3,literally -10 hp. get a grip... 
False,1,What the hell?! How can I know if I contracted the disease?? Fucking ginger I'm going now to kill every fucker in vault 81 if I have it!!
False,0,It's really stupid I read that even if your companions get hit you get it
False,0,"Yeah, either did i. But I did read up on if and you're right. It's bullshit. It's completely incurable with the only exception of one cure that you need to (or at least should) use on a kid. It really is Fallout aids."
False,0,I didn't get the disease while doing the mission
False,4,Gingers have no souls. You should have saved yourself.
False,0,What does it matter if he is gay or not
False,0,but you need to do a few missions for the bos before you get that mission with Danse 
False,0,"spoiler****
*
*
*
*
*
*
the power armor is permanent on him until you reach a quest where maxson tells you to find him and Danse is at a bunker. then he doesn't have the armor on"
False,0,R u gay is the question 
False,0,Kill him and take it off simple as that
False,0,Good. Attempting to download that damn update for a second time. Yourself?
False,0,Noce thanks peeps. How r u today ssj
False,1,I believe so. I used my friends. I think it was a Samsung headset. But it did work
False,0,I don't see why you couldn't...but not completely sure
False,0,lol I'd take his advice too^^ or hang back and bring a lot of ammo
False,0,the castle is just like taking over another settlement for them. basically 
False,0,"Yes that's right ^^ but that won't change anything for any other faction so if you want tge castle just do minute men missions until you get there ;). My advice for the first time going to the castle..take some powerful weaponry and good armor ;)
"
False,1,"you don't need to side with the minutemen the to get the castle. the minutemen are neutral. it's basically you side with the bos, institute or railroad. but you have the option to go with the minutemen if you don't want to join the other three. "
False,0,So the only way to get the castle is to side with minute men 
False,0,Besides that you can join all factoons once you meet their leaders lol 
False,1,"When you are up to a certain quest related to the brotherhood of steel and the institute, you must choose one or the other and the game will let you know this by coming up with a message telling you that your about to become hated by the other faction. 

However besides picking and choosing from the brotherhood and the institute, once you have passed that stage where you get the message and done the quest afterwards..you will get a selection of quests..seemigly one from each faction and these missions will initiate the finale and in doing so align you with that faction. So to sum up

You will not pick your end faction until after you have decided whether you will fight the institute or the brotherhood and you have completed that quest. But beware..siding with the institute (which is something I haven't done) may leave all other factions hating your guts because they are villified in the commonwealth. Also remember that once you have picked brotherhood or institute...the next faction missions you get will be the finale' and once you start one..for example the mission for the minute man 'protect thr castle'..Once you start that...that's it..no going back..so as most of us know..keep saving. Hope this helped..sorry it's wordy ^^'"
False,0,when you get the bunker hill quest or whenever one faction asks you to kill another
False,0,*small spoiler* when you build a teleporter for a quest the people you build it with is who you side with then there are a couple opertunities to change
False,0,I honestly don't like the new perk system. I wish I could have skills beach :/
False,0,"Well you have to think about it..They made fallout 4 on next gen..it has guns...so you have the ability to look down the sights because that's how you'd use a gun..right? In fallout 3 you couldn't aim down the sights and in new vegas you could..but did that change how the game played as an RPG? Not in my oppinion..it just helped make shooting on the game a smoother experience. So if you play it like a shooter I guess that's how you'll see it..but many people don't play it for the shooting..many people play it for the immursiveness of the world fallout is based, the lore, and the characters..and THAT is what makes it more RPG...in my opinion lol"
False,3,Fallout new vegas was the best fallout...fallout 4 has become a generic shooter with a light touch of rpg
False,3,Yoh obviously aren't playing like I am
False,1,Yay witcher 3 boo that your disappointed with fallout 4..
False,0,I can't play it either...it gets me bored really quick.
False,0,They did this one has an extra row
False,0,Two shot semi-auto combat rifle 124 damage un modified 
False,1,"My long barrel .44. It's called ""the dirty"". After Dirty Harry. "
False,0,"Combat shotgun that shoots an extra projectile. 125 damage, and thats with no perks to up it"
False,0,Two Shot 44 Magnum with the bull barrel and scope ( 264 damage ) 
False,0,Or Kellog's pistol
False,0,Hunting rifle. Any variant but short. 
False,1,Deliverer
False,0,My small .44 snub that I named in honor of a guy from PSN. It is called Little PP Big Heart.
False,0,50.cal Two shot Hunting rifle with a medium scope...ooooooweeee..or my Two shot combat shotgun..both over 200 dmg x) 
False,0,My full auto assault rifle
False,0,Yes
False,0,They are not real. So you must be a synth
False,0,Yeah you need to go to the institute
False,0,Kool
False,0,"All of the full sets of heavy armies look cool, especially raider"
False,0,It's fine. Thanks for the suggestions. Both of you. 
False,0,"Its still some good armor, some of the best other than metal"
False,0,"Oh that's my bad, sorry"
False,0,I know of the BoS and the star. I thought you were implying that there were more. 
False,0,"I think the only symbols are the BoS or a star, but its still cool to me"
False,0,Heavy is 101 energy and damage resistance
False,0,You said you could put symbols on the chest? 
False,0,Sturdy is 75 energy and damage resistance 
False,0,A full set that is
False,0,"If you bought a dog it'll stay at that settlement.
If you're talking about Dogmeat check any doghouses you sent him to"
False,0,Sorry
False,0,Say
False,0,Please day spoiler next time -_-
False,0,"And that spoiled it for someone, I'm sure, jackass."
False,5,Well seeing as you killed the BoS and they were his friends and family he probably got mad and left
False,0,Get Reformed stealth suit next
False,1,Hahaha ^
False,2,Hmm that's cool I didn't know now I know who to avoid muwahahaha
False,5,"To be exact his username is Theslitherysnake... forgot the ""the"".."
False,1,Yea me either.  They both great at catching that stuff like ON POINT. Lol
False,1,"I think he is. Everything seems to stop after he says it's solved. Anyway, him and I think Septic Death is. But i haven't seen him around for a while."
False,3,when will the update to see our older posts and posts we have commented on be out??
False,1,Kool admin
False,1,Thanks captin that shits annoying
False,2,What the hell news for me
False,0,In the basement....
False,1,It does its behind some sign that say don't touch it's below some catwalks
False,1,It's at corvega assembly plant.  On one of the ground floors it lead to a stash I think. 
False,1,Corvega plant. 
False,0,The charger i mean
False,0,Lol no
False,0,Did you power it with the orange..?
False,0,Oh and about my battery... its safe...i brought it to the power something i forgot the name

False,0,Oh yeah and local leader...durp
False,0,"Go into your workshop mode and select a settler you want to use for a supply line, you'll see the option at the bottom next to creat etc. Say you have all of your junk at Sanctuary and you want to be able to use those same resources at Red Rocket, you would need to create a supply line going from Red Rocket to Sanctuary..hope that helps ^^"
False,0,Is this No-Bark Noonan?
False,0,I'm not sure Gaurdian understands what's going on with the Orange..at least that's my professional oppinion.
False,2,Ok?
False,0,"It doesn't really bother me since I've never given her any ammunition and she seems to be using them no prolem. I just have to keep stealing the Fat Man from her or she goes crazy. 

For example, I was pickpocketing a guard who then turned hostile. Guess who got a mini nuke to the face?"
False,0,Oh. Have you thought about giving her a weapon and assigning it. That might fix it
False,0,She defaults to a laser rifle for long range and melee/bare handed for close range. 
False,0,"Neither, Kate. She just has a habit of looting bodies all around. "

The other companions have assigned we weapons but seeing as she used to be a Mrs,Nanny she probably doesn't have one"

False,0,So i can give a FAT MAN and 1 mini nuke to a guard and he would go on a rampage if raiders come? But he wont anyway i have 109 defence and no one have attacked the castle before
False,0,Nice thanks ^^
False,0,I watched a video about that they said to give them one bullet and it should be infinite for settlers at least haven't tried it with companions
False,0,Question kinda related to companions and weaponry..if you give a settler/companion a weapon can you still just give them a minimum amount of ammo (say...5?) and they will still just have infinite to use? Hope that makes sense..and apologies for putting a question in your topic ^^'.

False,0,What?
False,0,Shit just got weird
False,0,Wtf 
False,1,I am a raped Dog ok? D: 🐶
False,0,I don't wanna spoil the surprise though :/
False,0,Haha
False,0,"I was more of a mobster in it. I first accepted the bribe,raised it,took it and then shot down the baddies"
False,1,Everyone blew me off :(
False,0,Also I'm on Xbox One so it's possible it may not work that way on PC and PlayStation 
False,0,Unless they just fixed it with the patch I haven't let my meter deplete completely for a few days now so maybe they did if so sorry for the inaccurate advice lol
False,0,It doesn't give me any materials if the meter is empty and a few of my friends have said the same thing
False,0,The first part of what he said is wrong you still keep the materials when the size gets to empty 
False,0,Oh and if you drop weapons it drops that meter down fast . . And it seems like the more mods the weapon has the faster/more it drops the meter 
False,0,Okay be very careful doing that because the meter in the top right (settlement size meter) it will go down and if it gets to the point where it's empty you won't even get the materials from what you're scrapping . . . That is the way to shrink your settlement size so you can continue to build it up larger 
False,0,Yup that's where I am I used the railroad to build my stuff cause I was right there already but it doesn't matter who you have help build the stuff I dont think 
False,0,"It will tell you mate, 

Before the end mission properly begins it tell you you will either become enemies with the institute or everybody else and ask if you are sure etc. "
False,0,"Same, thats what i have been doing. I choose the BoS to create my teleporter into The Institute, so i hope that didnt matter"
False,0,Lol I hope that helps . . . It's what I'm doing . . . I like to do everything else like side quests and stuff then do the main story and its alternate endings 
False,0,I think you can just go until it pretty much says your going to piss some other faction off and that's where i stopped so I could do as much as I could for each of the factions . . . But I think you also need to already have joined more than one of them for it to even do that
False,1,And the Minutemen are there if you make all the other factions mad or you don't like them^
False,1,"The institute is the ending that's more emotion entered

BoS is just ""fuck everyone we're warlords"" ending

Railroad is more short term goal centered than the institute. 

I finished with the institute in the end"
False,0,Ahhh ok i thought id have to run in and join after i did that 
False,0,Do it. You don't join until a bit later and you have the decision to infiltrate whenever after deciding the chip or whatever 
False,0,Then u gotta go in and screw everything up as usual it would just be cool to learn what really happened to them after the games they were in ended 
False,0,My bad it just gets annoying and yeah anything can happen in these games im saying they join forces but obviously one of them is going to screw the other over when it comes down to it it would just be awesome to see those guys who are power houses join forces 
False,0,"Haha I second that. But to answer your question..I think that's one of those scenarios that's a never say never type deal..but I feel like the idea behind the war against China and America in the Fallout universe is to show that by the time the bombs fell..Most of the world was divided..even more so with the world's superpowers..I.E China and America.

But I suppose the Game is based pretty heavily on deception...I mean literally all you need as an example is the vaults. "
False,0,Don't take it so personally damn 
False,0,And just answer the fucking question don't correct me 
False,0,Actually the descendants of the pre war government there bud so yeah still the US government in my book  
False,0,The enclave isn't the old government. They were started before the war for post-war government. They were only known about in the last month before the bombs fell.

False,0,"They're decent. It's like when having a companion search for ""good loot"" off of bodies or from containers but just junk items. If you want good junk items and such then make the first store listed in workshop, they sell good stuff at those in general but that's the one that give junk items I believe. "

False,0,"In the southeast of the map you can not far from Poseidon plant there is a giddy up buttercup factory with supermutants in it. Clear them out and get to the roof, there will be a large yellow duct, climb on top and you can see a very large pipe that you can jump on, walk down the pipe until you find a hole, you can get into the pipe and walk through it and at the end is a steamer trunk with some goodies and it is surrounded by about 10 bags of cement "
False,0,Where is connie and whats shipment of stuff like what does shipment of stuf mean?
False,0,I believe there's some in Hardware Town
False,0,I forget exactly who but you can buy shipments of concrete. I think Connie Abernathy sells them.
False,2,"Yeah Sanctuary is the only place I've done the multiple house thing. Because it's hard attempting to protect all of them. Plus, when you scrap the houses, there's just foundations that are easy to build on. I build a bar on one, a market on the other, then put a artillery canon on one, and finally made a (nonfunctional) basketball court."
False,1,"There's a small quest (Idk if it's a side quest or unmarked quest) but there's a guy at the Slog that is trying to repair a Giddy Up Buttercup. You can tell him where the parts are, or you can bring them to him. It's in the Wilson Atomatoys Factory."
False,3,"Thanks fellas.

To answer your question, it really depends on the size of the settlement and what mood I'm in. I made a huge one building settlement on the island. But in Sanctuary, I have a few prefabs and some built housing. I may scrap them and just use the houses that come with the settlement. "
False,2,"@jjuice I think there may be a quest where someone wants one but not 100% on that. Otherwise they are just decorations. 
I have a room in my settlement where it's just a table with a knife on it and random bits of horses around 😜"
False,1, I always go to the Atomatoy places and pick them up. They replenish after a while and you just need to kill a few super mutants.
False,2,"The full Giggy ups can fetch a pretty penny. Besides that I usually keep the parts (legs, arms, or heads) and scrap them. They have a fair amount of screws, steel, etc. in them."
False,1,"Now, my question is, do you guys build giant buildings that house everything? Or do you build a bunch of smaller building or individual homes? I tend to build giant buildings so I can use a side of that building as a fence too."
False,1,Are the Giddy Ups just decorations or do they have a purpose? I bought a complete Giddy Up but have yet to see what purpose it serves.
False,1,Oh and that too ^
False,2,"Yeah that would be cool. But I don't know about structures you build. Because they are suppose to be rustic, and messy. If you could restore something than fine.

But I'd like to see a little more verity of building materials. Most of all, I'd like to level out the damn ground. So I can build a three story building, but I can't level out the ground?"
False,0,Use Space if you're on PC
False,0,Yea
False,0,The first 2 turrets actually don't need a wire btw. They're wireless
False,0,"If on console, Y for Xbox, Triangle for PS4 and not sure for PC"
False,0,"That's an interesting thought. I'll try it out when I get on next time. 
Thanks for that, the timing on the shipments of water is driving me nuts.
"
False,1,Guys i think when u say u leave for an hour and have less its probably because you are not fast traveling alot and the other time when you had more in less game time you might have been fast traveling alot taking up more in-game time 
False,0,"On the plus side, if your income is endless, you won't have to worry about jumping from settlement to settlement. One at at time."
False,1,True. Like I said I'm at the point of building the essentials and moving on. But yeah I'm close to the point where I'm going to build all my settles that get by and make them better. And yes. I'm guessing the more you have the better the changes.
False,1,"That's mainly why I said build a ton of them, obviously your chances of coming back to 2000 caps worth of water is substantially higher than what your chances would be if you had fewer purifiers. I have about 20 set up at my base now and it can be quite impressive with how many caps you can earn."
False,0,"Well, it seems like there is no rhyme or reason to it. It just makes purified water at different rates really depending on nothing. Sometimes there's alot. Sometimes there isn't. It's kinda stupid if you ask me. Ad long as there's more water then people then you'll get some. But how much and when seems like the question many have."
False,0,Hahaha will do. I find this to be a good way to make caps too. I'll look around on the Internet too.
False,0,"To be honest man, I have no set answer. Sometimes I'll leave the settlement for 10 minutes and come back to 90 water and other times I'll be gone an hour or two and only come back to 40 water. If you find a pattern please let me know lol"
False,0,How long does it take for water to replenish in the settlement's workbench? Because I go to Sanctuary and there'll be like 70 purified waters. But then I'll go back and only get like 7. So do you have any idea about how long it takes?
False,0,"Update: in the last 2 hours or so, I've made about 10,000 caps. The worth is real."
False,1,"Ya I haven't herd much on them. And I've only used it twice other than the first mission.

2. Found one on my way to clear a base and it was missing a leg lol "

False,4,"Just take your time, focus on side quests first, search the map, literally collect everything. The minutemen story line is good for starters as it helps explore the map and get decent weaponary. 

Spend your perk points wisely, i reccomend scavenger and scrounger as this will help with getting extra junk from scrapped weapons and extra ammo from crates! 

Mainly enjoy yourself! Speak to everybody, get to know them, them drimk some whiskey, blow their heads off, strip them and piss on their corpse!

False,0,May not become dlc skyrim had some cut quests even once all the dlc came out. We can hope though.
False,0,We are finding all of these cut things in the game files and only to think this game was planned to be bigger than it actually is
False,0,"I noticed those creatures the moment I came across them. Initially I thought it meant the oceans were occupied by them and it would be dangerous to swim. Similar to how Skyrim had underwater creatures. It's a shame, hopefully they do add it back."
False,3,I wish they had more quests in general
False,1,"Interesting,I hope they will add the quest in a later update or DLC"
False,1,I doubt it ^ there was cut content in New Vegas that never made it to DLC but I guess it's possible...
False,2,"Teah. I'm guessing it's going to be a DLC. Most of the work is done already. I.e. harpoon gun files exist. So do these creatures scattered around the shores. I know that in Gameinformer, they were going to cut settlement building if they had to cut something. At least according to someone from Bethesda. Maybe settlement building took up so much time that one quest wasn't finished? Anyway, I'm happy them kept settlement building. If i have to sacrifice one side quest for it, I'm fine with that. I still see a future dlc."
False,0,they probably would have made the mission so you can only do it with your aqua boy perks maxed out or something like that

False,0,Overseers guardian
False,0,Yeah a pipe pistol.
False,0,38 ammo is mainly for crude pipe guns.. Which is crap. Don't think anything good can come out of 38...
False,0,I am not sure about how that works. Apparently you assign a settler to the scavenging station and they will gather more resources from what I've read.
False,0,Related question : and what about scavenging stations?
False,0,They share your resources from a settlement of your choice to another.

False,1,Really? I just ran through and hoped for the best.
False,1,Lmao that reminds me of when I first started playing fallout 3 I would go in shops and put a bucket on the head of whoever owned it and I would steal everything that was sitting around . . . Shit sometimes I could even steal the bucket right off there head (mad skills) if I used one they had sitting around

False,0,Corvega plant tons of aluminum
False,2,If you have the scrapper perks you get 11 aluminum from assault rifles
False,0,"Shiny tin cans are everywhere, also pick up dinner or surgical trays. Tag it in your workshop and it will highlight all items. "
False,1,The corvaga car plant has Aluminium bits on the conveyor. - hub caps possibly 
False,1,Dinner trays have 3
False,2,The weapon seller in Diamond City sell aluminium pack (x50)
False,2,"There is a way to get a lot of aluminum pretty quick . . . Depends if you want to use a glitch or not . . . And there is also a way to get like over 1,000,000 in like 10 minutes but that's my secret muahahahaha "
False,1,I dont no where i think its a fish factory somewhere north east but there is a ton of aluminum if you follow the conver belt
False,0,Yeah it might be bugged or maybe something went wrong in your save file . . Sorry I can't help 
False,0,I've tried that too. Even uninstalled and then reinstalled the game. The game must hate me or something. 
False,0,Yeah idk what to do for that haha maybe try to send them somewhere else?
False,0,I've also waited days on end and even tried following them to make sure they don't die. The Scribe just suddenly vanishes and Larry just walks back and forth.
False,0,I have my weapon and armor emporiums there. They're two of the traders that you can meet randomly. 
False,0,Also if you just sent the settlers there from somewhere else it takes them a while to walk to the designated settlement

False,1,"Would have been fun to see a big mutated cat of some sort, like a glowing giant siamese lol"
False,3,"In the wasteland they are extinct. Basically only dogs are left according to lore (as I understand it) but that said, how many ""thought to be extinct"" animals have made comeback appearances in the past 5-10 years (IRL)? It's always possible. And who's word are we taking? Moira brown? She don't know shit. "
False,0,I thought there were a million places they could have hidden and survived. There's every vault or cave system and the sewers. Cats are crafty I think they would make it. And I've never heard any reference to them being extinct but I've only played the Xbox games so I'm not a scholar on the older games. Just what I've read in the timeline. 
False,0,"I got kinda annoyed. Cats have been mentioned to be extinct multiple times throughout the games. Granted, maybe one of the Commonwealth vaults had a few stray cat get into it."
False,0,Reginald's suit for the win. I use that and a pair of glasses for an extra 4 points.

False,0,"You won, thanks to some others proving the point and having your back. If it was your word against his ,he would've kept going."
False,0,Ha random battle speak
False,0,Ikr I was like damn this convo got real but I did tell him to kill himself so I understand the retaliation 
False,0,Who would have said it would take such a turn.
False,0,It was an automatic response in my brain thinking he's leaving the chat so I was saying goodbye to him plus I like to use old stuff like broski or what's poppin sloam idk how to spell it but yea it's like fun on a bun
False,0,Yes metal beard that where I'm from. Apparently poopbags is a few hours south of me.

False,0,I wish there was an interplayer trading system. I'd gladly give up a lot for more copper.
False,0,"Lol tell me about it I have over 20,000 adhesive . . . I'm a major hoarder in fallout "
False,0,I have a surplus of almost everything other than copper. :(

False,0,"Yep. 
Prob the best way to get caps now is with purified water or mutfruit farms "
False,0,Yes.*sobs*
False,0,No
False,0,"They don't need fuszion cores, atleast they didn't pre-patch. I am not sure about the new version"
False,0,No
False,0,Thanks guys but before the conversation I just used a jet and a psycho and went into sneak with my sniper and destroyed that fool
False,2,Yeah i told them to kill me first. You need very high charisma though.
False,0,Scaring the raiders crew is a hard speech check i think
False,0,"Yeah, if you can pass a speech check and tell them to kill you first, and kill em quick so Kent won't die"
False,0,"You must scare the raiders crew, after that they will run away, as they do this shoot the raider holding Kent hostage."
False,0,Ok
False,0,Well I just learned that they have admins on this sight so they got that covered unless they need more which might be the problem
False,0,"They could monitor or like scan the pic to see if it is bad 
Something like that maybe"
False,0,I mean yea I know what you meant but I was think about the other population of this app that would use it to be asses
False,0,Oh lol
False,0,When I was talking about posting pics about fallout I just wonted to see what people have done
False,0,Daxter I like your use of simplifying your words
False,0,I don't I have the game
False,0,"That would be nice
I think they need the system of allowing to people to view their posts from their profile with the option of having me notifications for each individual post like and a follow button for other posts that aren't yours"
False,0,Ya so u don't have to scroll and look it
False,0,Yeah the stores are only open from like 8am-8pm something dumb like that so if you're trying to trade and it's not between those times just sleep/wait it out 
False,0,Keep in mind that they do need to sleep at night that may be your issue?
False,0,I've never had issues after j assigned them to it 
False,0,dont lie to the community
False,1,You're halrious. ... Har Har 😐
False,0,"It was at 40 at one point, stop stalling"
False,0,Maybe I haven't noticed anything different except the fix where the button for picking up items in the container is now the same as your activate button
False,0,But yeah the assault rifle is all I know that uses the 5.56 rounds
False,1,Uhh just putting it out there the Gauss rifle and the last minute (legendary gauss rifle) both use the 2mm Electromagnetic Cartridges definitely not the 5.56 Rounds 
False,0,The last minute
False,0,Ok thanks 
False,0,I think assult rifle is the only real option as far as 5.56mm
False,2,5.56 is also for assault rifles.
False,0,Nvm
False,0,Didn't get it
False,0,And don't forget about phsyco
False,0,Killing the synths and all that.

False,0,Furious Power Fist
False,1,"2076 World Series Baseball Bat, sends 'em flying"
False,0,With costume 
False,0,I suppose it depends on level but I got a legendary gunner general with four gunners taking on a legendary alpha deathclaw and a legendary glowing deathclaw. Good few minutes entertainment then pop down to finish them off and loot the legendary items. Perfect way to start the day. 
False,0,That was the best raiders vs deathclaws 
False,1,Doing this right now so far there are 3 raiders a death claw and a glowing death claw
False,0,Go for it Gosnin. Post the results up here. 😉
False,0,hehe certain death on survival.
False,0,Thats fun lol
False,1,"Congratulations, you played yourself. Jetpack is less frustrating. And how do you get it with no jetpack anyway"
False,0,Lucky!! (It's the dawgpound btw) lol
False,0,How did you do that?
False,0,Did you use the trash can?
False,0,I've now set a new goal for myself. To also get the freefall legs with no jetpack.
False,0,Very nice congrats 
False,0,Cheers
False,0,Yea that's what I'm doing. Keeping my good save for DLC than another save for a alternate timeline save
False,0,"Lmao true, I may just start a new game but still keep this game as well. Plus, I could side with more than one faction that way."
False,0,Just start a new game and be a hobo
False,0,"Yes, but I feel like it took away half the fun of looting things lol"
False,0,Because have caps is key 
False,0,N would be sweet.  Even captin in here ;) so maybe just MAYBE lol
False,0,Thanks tho guys for the info.  Precitate that.  Well lates peeps im out now for reals 
False,1,Yeah way too much water...
False,1,I'm guessing it'll be a DLC because it seems like everything is already in place for it. But I really can't say.
False,1,Yea they should tho bring it back. Too much water everywhere
False,0,"its not a dlc its a side quest
that got cut from the game
"
False,0,Awwwww that blows lol. They should bring it back. Super mutants r getting old lol n i hardly find deathclaws anymore. Wondering if i killed em all already 
False,0,Yea but look it up on here bro i went under n it read the backstory on it n it looks like theres a shit ton n yea i meant it Quests

False,0,Seeing *
False,1,I completely changed my character from 30 to 50. I used to only use power armor now I'm pretty much the suavest silver shroud. I think putting time into one character and setting everything is worth it.
False,0,Drugs will do mama in
False,0,Mama murphy does die tho bro.  Or well u can kill her off lol
False,1,"Well Marcy, Jun, Mama Poopy and Sturges can't die."
False,1,I don't think Provisioners can die unless you actually kill them.
False,1,I didn't care about the people really...just the supply route brahmin.
False,1,Me too. Luckily it wasn't near an important settlement
False,2,"Well thanks, I shat my seeds thinking the people from sanctuary could get fucked by Deathclaws"
False,1,It's a random event 
False,1,"Yeah its a ""random event"" I think"
False,1,That happened to me really close to my base at Red Rocket. And I shot them too.
False,0,These radiant quests got me going crazy
False,0,Piper is that you!!!????
False,0,"I've been playing for 4 days and 10 hours and still have so much left to do, barely started the main story. Just joins bos and railroad, haven't taken the castle yet for minutemen. So many companions left to max out. Haven't found cait yet. Haven't even built myself a house"
False,0,"(And I am not going to, so yup)"
False,0,"Now that you say that, I realize it is true. I should do something about it."
False,0,So basically no one has a life here ha at least I'm not alone
False,0,I have played only twice for 2-3 hours in two weeks. With free afternoons
False,0,Lol I have over 100 hours on steam it's still pretty fun to me
False,0,But for real today I just got soooo fucking bored of fallout but I'll probably hop on tomorrow 
False,0,Ahhhhhhh yeeeeeaaaaaah
False,0,"And University Point. They both generators, an area for food, and other settlement amenities."
False,1,Agreed
False,1,"^I agree and disagree with you. Personally I prefered oblivion to skyrim, never played nv as I heard it was buggy as fuck, fallout 3 best bit was mothership for me and I prefer fallout 4. Eso I just find so mind numbingly dull that I would rather eat my own man veg than play it again.

This doesn't mean I can't appreciate the ones I wasnt a fan of tho, and you can see where they have learned from their mistakes.

All that said tho I only really play es games on pc for all the mods. I know fallout has them too but I actually prefer fallout unmodded."
False,1,"Yeah guys, but you all gotta remember that this is the first game for this new systems (PS4 and Xbox one) they always suck at first game for new consoles. Take oblivion first, then voilà they created Skyrim (for PS3 and Xbox 360). Now they sucked with ESO (first one for Ps4 and xbox one). Then take Fallout 3 (you gotta admit the game sucks or feels empty without the expansions they created later), then voilà they created fallout New Vegas !! Now they have Fallout 4 , and I believe their add ons are going to be a blast!"
False,1,And the new Vegas quest lines in the individual casinos were cool and some dark. Need more of that shit.
False,1,"I feel like there are less quest that involve manipulating people like ""memory lane"" and mostly just brutal killing."
False,3,"Yeah i agree with that. You can build a freaking tower. But get a few shovels and level out the ground? No..... no, no, no....."
False,3,Agreed. I just wanted more fallout. I love the level cap so I can actually have all the perks . I am disappointed about not being able to edit bits of terrain. (*cough* Spectacle Island *cough*) not like massively but a system you could do so.
False,2,Here...have a like *200 bottlecaps added*
False,1,"The thing I'm mad about is how much of the map is water. Plus, the fact that all the ends involve mass murder. Not that it didn't in other games. But this one just feels so unjustifiable.

As far as hype goes, I was just hyped for a new Fallout. If this game truly is just like FO3 or FONV I knew i wouldn't care. I was just so hyped for more Fallout."
False,0,Middle school an ur gonna have a fun ass time getting to it
False,1,It's under the kitchen table 
False,2,Middle School is the correct answer.
False,2,The only Vault actually in downtown Boston is Vault 114
False,2,"Just look it up on the wiki, there's no Vault under Diamond City. You can trust me"
False,0,Well idk who to believe
False,2,Malden is far North and West of Diamond City
False,2,"He's lying, its under Malden Middle School"
False,0,Thanks my nigga
False,0,Under Diamond City.
False,0,I miss the leg sweep from New Vegas lol
False,0,Hell yea sounds like fun times 
False,1,Yes please explain sounds fun lol
False,0,I believe pain train makes you able to knock down or stagger enemies while in power armor
False,0,Train train choo choo!
False,0,Sounds awesome. I dnt have that yet. Whats it do?
False,0,Hahah never hurts to ask.
False,0,"Alright, just curious. You never know, ya know? Lol"
False,0,Don't think so.
False,0,No its always T-60
False,0,It depends on the place for me. But it's a good idea.
False,1,If you look on the wikia under items. Theres a sub section for perk magazines. I usually check under notable loot when I enter a building so I don't miss anything. 
False,0,Yeah. Half of the settlers at any of my settlements don't even have jobs. Usually I'll just make sure they get enough food and leave.
False,0,"Lmfao! Settlers are borderline useless. Some of them at some of my bases are assigned to a shop, but they'll be in Butt Fuck Egypt just standing there looking at shiny shit."
False,2,"Fallout is meant to target your OCD. I've been trying to keep my settlement supply lines looking good on the pipboy. You know, not crossing eachother or anything. But, one day I look and apparently I accidentally sent one across the map. So, I attempted to hunt him down for about an hour just so I could change his destination. OCD as fuck hahaha."
False,1,You're not lying. I just want to complete my magazine rack lol. OCD is going off. 
False,0,Honestly it's hard to say one location. There are just so many! 
False,0,My idea is to add drivable cats
False,0,"Going to help the Brotherhood take back the Citadel 
"
False,1,"My wishes for DLC...

1. Settlement Pack - Adds more options for settlers and building materials. Maybe some new settlement locations or the ability to convert existing areas (like University Point or Quincy Ruins).

2. Enclave Revenge - Enclave remnants regrouped after their loss in DC, and attempt to invade the commonwealth. How you handle them depends on the faction you sided with. Idk, bring back the Enclave! Lol

3. Mutiny - The super mutants start getting more organized and stronger to attempt to take the commonwealth over. They unleash some FEV into the wasteland to convert others. You have to stop them from spreading FEV and take down their leader. 

Now I say all of this to say, but usually Bethesda adds entire new locations/exploitable areas outside the game location in their DLC's. So most likely the expansions will take us somewhere else in or out of the commonwealth. "
False,0,[To Jtabes] so basically going to Canada that sounds cool
False,0, As another dog companion maybe a mutant hound
False,0,DLC companion idea an Enclave scientist who had his brain transplanted into a deathclaw as a colleagues selfish revenge plan and which kills the scientist  and destroys their bunker .his likes and dislikes compared to your choices with science and befriending animals Plus who wouldn't want a deathclaw as a friend I sure don't like them as enemies .he can't speak until he write down in the dirt that he needs you to make him a voice  translator ( this last piece is optional)
False,0,I would like to see like a mountain range with snow to the north of the map!
False,0,Sounds like a good idea

False,1,Well I'll be patiently waiting for the mod then :p
False,1,That's pretty sick bruh. You can't torture for the same reason you can't kill kids. It's something they don't want to be associated with. I've read stuff that raiders wrote talking about torture. But that's completely different then actually being able to torture.
False,0,so I'm guessing this Clint guy is at Quincy?  haven't come across him yet

False,1,I killed her too.  Sometime later I randomly ran into Mel while out exploring.  He was pretty butt hurt about the whole thing.
False,2,"Haha weird
I killed her too"
False,0,Girl in charge of the institute ? Ew. 
False,0,)
False,0,"Among many other things ( settlement building, redone gunplay, etc."
False,0,"It's hard to go back and find every instance of Father and redo it as ""Mother"". If one line is missed, it causes continuity errors. Plus, a new person would have to be designed and animated, and all the lines mentioning Father would have to be re-recorded.

I'm guessing they assumed people would be happy with character customization."
False,0,"Apparently a Woman can't lead the institute so that's why I made a different plot type of deal. But yeah, I bet it would be because of that."
False,0,"Good point. The Institute could be run by ""Mother""

I'm guessing because they would have to rewrite a lot of minor dialogue through the whole main story.

False,0,Ey that person went to surgery... left the carcass at my front door
False,0,Nah...
False,0,Shut up
False,1,Read my previous reply
False,0,Touchè. I just hate spoilers man. Peace ✌
False,1,And I never said I had the right. I said expect there to be spoilers on here and not to be butt hurt.
False,0,S3 I clearly said I put spoiler in my post. Chill out.
False,0,"It's common courtesy. I got things spoiled when I hopped on here. But it was during the first few weeks when there wasn't any information on quests out there.

I'm going to continue to say it. It's only right. What happens if DLC comes out? Are you still just going to spoil things because you think you have a right to?"
False,0,You can look for specific things just searching it up.
False,0,People come here looking for tips and help too. Using a spoiler warning is just polite.
False,0,Word yo
False,0,Agreed 
False,6,Then look at reviews. Not discussion boards. We're here to discuss. xD
False,1,Yes but people like to discuss other things not just the entire game it's like reviews for a movie your about to watch
False,0,Oh and on the mass fission building was really bad 
False,0,Yes and not .. Elevators hang for me .. And found a couple corners that are like a bad acid trip lol
False,0,"I've been receiving quests I've already done over and over, I walk outside to the second floor of a building and I fell through the ground and everything went white, Hancock randomly went hostile on me while doing the Saugus quest and etc."
False,0,Been running excellent on my xbone
False,0,Either did i. But lately I've had quests that won't give me a marker. Pissing me off 
False,0,"Nothing game breaking. Been running good. Few minor glitches - quarry guy got chased in the pond by mirelurks and was underwater for a few days. Self corrected eventually. Raiders caught in stairs (not under, not on.  IN), armor details missing so it looks like my combat armor was floating a few inches in front of me, Brahmin stuck half inside the house and half out the window in sanctuary, etc.. All very minor and somewhat humorous. "
False,0,"I honestly only ever had one and I'm,not so sure if it was a glitch or a super mutant just being stupid, but he was by a door as we were shooting each other, and he disappeared for a sec then reappeared and continued to blast me. Other than that it's been pretty magnificent. I guess maybe I was just used to glitchy as all hell Skyrim and then they brought this out and I was quite impressed"
False,0,Mine has also been running very smoothly. Alittle skipping during combat but not enough to cause any problems. I've been very impressed with the game and how well it works. After three I was expecting more glitches but they seem to have figured it out. 
False,0,I haven't had a single problem but one crash since launch. 
False,0,But besides that the only other major bug I've had was when I jumped into the quarry to get the pumps working and I couldn't move. When I reloaded the save I jumped in and was stuck in an infinite loading screen. Decided to play some CoD instead. Lol

False,0,Thanks tree I didn't know that last bit and I love me some paint jobs. Been on this app for 20mins and already laughed and learnt so much (even avoided spoilers!!)
False,1,"I would suggest hanging round the railroad till you get the deliverer and the ballistic weave armor mod though. Then you can just murder them all with a rusty fork if you really want. 
Be in good books with the institute and when you are in their facility walk around and take all there instruments in the labs because it's a really good source or aluminum. Then show them the rusty fork and get some sweet power armor from your brothers in steal 👍🏽 
Well that's my plan anyway. 
However if you do side with institute you get a pretty sweet white paint job in the end for your power armor. "
False,0,Just from what mr donut hole has said in going to play it safe and stick with brotherhood just in case lol.im a bit of a sucker for rare armour lol. I was thinking the brotherhood for that part anyways and if it dose not affect anything I may as well stick with them and suck up a bit lol  
False,0,Well I sided with the brotherhood.....I built the teleporter with the minute men and after the endgame with the brotherhood I got 3 legendary power armour pieces and another item the captain gives u the helm and the others are at the store I'm currently looking into the others now
False,0,"The only other faction is the Minutemen, but they're garbage. And who you choose for thag part affects literally nothing"
False,0,Thank you Arthur my friend :) 
False,0,"Well im not quite sure because I only just met the railroad, I usually just side with the brotherhood but if another option gets me better shit then fuck them lol "
False,0,Who you build the teleporter with does not affect anything
False,0,Depends on what you want to do

So 2,000/8=250"
False,3,talk about inflation.... iguana bits for over 1000$
False,2,"A currency strap is what holds the money together as shown in ""pre war money"" those in the US only come in quantities of 100 bills for any bill type above $1. Thus, 1 pre war money is $2,000. So 2,000/10=200.

*20000 percent Saluting the Prydwen "
False,0,1% building settlements*
False,0,Lol Idk I'm just thinking outside the box I don't I'm right. But I'm curious now lol
False,0,Better than my answer. It would be to obvious of it was in fact a radscorpion. That being said I think he just gives out a code for fallout shelter if you get it right. I don't even play that game. Haha 
False,0,"Vault 95. Green as in Sick because they're all on withdrawal, big sting because some of the chems are injected, they're underground. And they're definitely not clean because they eventually find more drugs!"
False,1,How about glowing radscorpion?
False,0,"I'm going with radscorpion. Molerats bite, not sting."
False,3,I PRESENT TO YOU OXICLEAN MAX ENFORCER!!!!
False,1,Radscorpion? Or molerats?
False,0,Oh brother Thomas is in pieces on the stage at the amphitheater 
False,0,Just killed that retahd too
False,1,"Don't forget ""Brother Thomas""...that cabron"
False,0,Make sure to get the laser gatling gun first from the BOS I made a mistake by not buying it now I cant find it anywhere! :(
False,0,Institute has cool quests and gorillas.
False,0,For the ending that is of course.
False,1,"I suppose you are an adult. Good manners, something many lack... (myself included). Well I can speak for the BoS, their missions are your regular fetch and rarely speak with someone. If you decide to side with them you'll get a somewhat ""nostalgic"" solution but if you ask me, it isn't that good. "
False,2,Bos
False,0,You do get a jet pack if you go with the BOS
False,0,No problem
False,0,Thanks man
False,0,Yes with what the other guy said
False,0,And u build the jetpack?
False,0,Thank you Captain.
False,0,I am not sure about them staying with you if you side with the institute. And the decision is up to you. It is supposed to add replayability.
False,1,You need science level 4 and armour level 4
False,0,"No, you can get it by spending points in (I believe it is) the Armorer perk. And yes, the Minutemen can stay with you if you side with the BoS"
False,0,Apparently there is a new one
False,0,This being the ammo glitch to take all the vendors stuff ?
False,0,Sadly yes. I had a ceremony and funeral for that bug
False,1,Yup
False,0,Good idea
False,0,I'm trying to make one of each variant. T-45 A-D etc for all model types 
False,0,I've only got 10 or so right now. I'm starting a pseudo terra cotta army at castle. 
False,0,"After some time you will find a ton of it,I managed to make a full t60 set for each paintjob"
False,0,Yep
False,0,I don't get the point in haveing that much power armor. Is it just a thing to show off
False,0,Same IM MAKING AN ARMY TO RULE THE WORLD jk just hoarding
False,0,Yeah but I only use one lol I'm pretty much just hoarding it 
False,0,Yeah... I do. I've just been leaving ones that aren't at least a T-60 because I'd run out of room them.
False,0,Im saveing up lol
False,1,Codes ? If I may ask what are these lol
False,0,You'll see it is worth it.
False,0,What do the codes do
False,0,;)
False,0,Nobody has games or anything for my phone OS.
False,0,What about Steak and Brecol codes?
False,0,The railroad are just a bunch of hippies
False,0,The minutemen are what you make of them. You arm them and you build their city. They are nothing without you and you are nothing without them. All the other factions are established somewhat. The minutemen rely on you. 
False,0,Bos
False,0,Jeez ok... they become megazords
False,1,Join the Brotherhood
False,0,"Yeah, they are pipis but if you put them in a power armor..."
False,0,"They are dicks, don't get me wrong..."
False,0,Even considering how strong they are?
False,0,I'm doing a Minuteman / Railroad quest line .. eventually going to try and join the BOS to rob everyone for their PA but they will all be dead in the end. 
False,0,It's just I sided with them on a previous character.
False,0,Never happened to me either.....
False,0,Thats never happened to me. Have you tried taking it out and plugging it back in
False,0,I've never had that problem.... :/
False,1,Hmmmm..
False,0,You can get the perks to build your own jet packs.  
False,0,They offer MEGAZORDS
False,0,Jet pack at the ending
False,0,It gives you lunch boxes to open 
False,0,What do they do?
False,0,"""Fallout shelter codes below."""
False,0,What does it do
False,0,"If it does not work, someone beat you to it."
False,0,There are some places in the game where you can walk through a decontamination things idk where though 
False,0,Or craft refreshing beverage
False,0,Cook Mutt chops or go to any doctor
False,0,Mutant hound meat does the trick
False,0,"Drink water from polluted sources. Also, going to the glowing sea helps. Jk just go to a doctor "
False,0,Oh sorry then
False,0,Theres meat u can make as well that takes away rads n gives u health
False,0,Yeah..umm..i dont know where there is a doctor. Only one i know is in Diamond City and i havent gotten their yet
False,0,You can just talk to a doctor if you don't have any radaway
False,0,Yea he's a little shut head and will disappear for a while. Usually when you need him. 
False,0,Ok cool thanks
False,1,"The dog will randomly wander off. BUT sometimes in open world combat, it will randomly show up to help, then will wander away again."
False,0,U havw to check if u accidentally didnt send him somewhere or made him stay in one place.
False,0,Thanks
False,1,It happens along with the main quests 
False,1,"Yeah. But I want to play as the Sole Survivor. Not some other person. If i got to keep everything afterward, I'd be cool with it I guess."
False,1,"Why me!? I haven't done anything to you dorito! You know what.....ghoul you, I wish you could become a ghoul. You and your famiy are a ghouls"
False,1,I could see it being an add on that runs parallel to the main story. Maybe being a ghoul survivor from a different vault that gets opened when the Sole Survivor stumbles upon it and adventuring out to the wasteland from there. 
False,2,"Yeah. It should be a decision. I hope I  the next Fallout you can pick between Like 3 different character starts. I don't know how that would work as far a Canon goes. But like one where you are a ghoul, one where you are a vault dweller, or like a BoS member."
False,1,Like maybe an after-main story side quest. Or a DLC. 
False,1,"Yeah, but that would take away the radiation danger as a hazard and something that needs to be considered when strategizing."
False,0,I thought you would after Hancock mentions that crazy drug that turned him
False,1,I think you upgrade the base dmg. On top of the it is add the  bonuses from perks magazine etc.
False,0,Nah
False,1,Great against ghouls if ur using the berserk syringe 
False,0,*beat  it to deth
False,1,Paralyze a target and bit it to death...or get 2 super mutants crazy and watch them fight to the end..
False,2,Got 4 of em never used it. Supposed to be really rare but I got em stockpiled.
False,0,Ammo crafting is not that bad.. some of the effects look pretty interesting...
False,2,I didn't see the point. You need to craft you own ammo
False,1,No
False,1,Oh really? Well I know what I'm spending my next perks on!
False,0,Thanks
False,1,When it comes to those perks 
False,1,Shotguns count as assault rifles
False,0,*shit 
False,0,Oh shot haha good thing I have a 145 of them
False,0,"The ammo is fusion cores, you're just using all them up"
False,0,I think you just need to follow The minutemen. They only have a problem with the institute
False,1,Yeah. I read a little about it but I wasn't sure how. It made it seem like you need to follow very precise steps.
False,1,How? Please tell me
False,1,There's a way to save the Minutemen railroad and brotherhood
False,1," No, I went with the brotherhood. So much death. So much destruction. War, war never changes."
False,0,"Thanks I will try again, I will have to be patient lol"
False,0,"Check the bar on the prydwen (or maybe in the airport?). He's not there all hours of the day though.  I've got the same problem and this was the solution I found online, but haven't tried it yet"
False,0,Let me know either way! After Blind Betrayal you should be able to have Danse as a full time and be able to romance him! Good luck! 
False,0,"Ahhh well I have blind betrayal waiting to start, maybe that's why, thanks anyway, il try again soon, maybe he's glitchy or something. 😊"
False,1,"By the way, Blind Betrayal is the mission I was thinking of earlier."
False,0,Same here. I'll see if I can recreate the situation and find a solution. I'll let you know either way. Would you prefer a response on this thread or over Xbox Live?
False,0,Yep. 
False,0,Good point. Playing on Xbox?
False,0,"He's always been there after I did a certain misson, obviously with never having him as a companion it's not like iv sent him anywhere else. "
False,0,Hmm... So he said he was going to the Prydwen. Have you checked all your settlements? I lost Piper and Curie for a while. I found them wandering Sanctuary. It never hurts to check.
False,0,"Agreed. I posted on here, saying that it would be cool for the next game. But people just replied, ""so, basically Fallout shelter?"" But I'm with you man! "
False,0,That'd be cool. I'd like to be able to visually customize your armor too 
False,0,"Yeah, remove the never melting corpses."
False,0,Ok I guess I'll just have he sanctuary as my main settlement. Thanks anyways
False,0,Hmm that's odd seems like a bug.  Preston won't follow you if you beat it with the brotherhood
False,1,"Unfortunately, it did not work. I even tried activating a siren, but they are still in the museum, fighting off raiders like the first mission. Sanctuary still counts them as settlers, and Preston won't be my follower anymore."
False,1,"Ok, let us know how it goes! And good luck!"
False,2,I'll try that thanks
False,1,"Preston won't say anything different to you if you beat it with the brotherhood. He'll only give you the repeatable quests for The minutemen. Try building in sanctuary, that might attract them."
False,0,That deathclaw was tearing through them until he got a shot
False,0,Rip deathclaw
False,0,But the gunner got wat he deserved 
False,0,I didnt get hit by it but the deathclaw attacking him did lol
False,0,Please tell me a legendary raider was using it on you. And you were like wtf this guy is destroying me 😂
False,1,I got a two shot sniper on my stealth build.... so orgasmic
False,0,Also everyone is in stiffy mode
False,0,Ha plus that door isn't available to you right now 
False,1,"Yeah, I'd like to create something that people can contribute to. My X-01 post I update as people tell me they've found other sets that I have not located yet. But, it's hard when there's no notifications saying that someone's replied. 

I was thinking about showing how I set up a settlement from beginning to 100% satisfaction. That might help a few players."
False,0,"Yeah. You should create something so you everyone can contribute. I trust you will do a great job, but surely you can't know everything! Haha but you'd just need to keep the trolls out. 

Anyway, I think a guide. Obviously, what you are describing is this app. But maybe like a general guide from start to finish. But it's uo to you man!"
False,0,"Tips, item locations, quest tips/guides, anything really. I've done one on X-01 Power Armor locations and all Bobbleheads, but I'm happy to do more. "
False,0,No your mom jk
False,0,"What do you mean? Like general tips, weapon and armor locations, settlement building, or like a quest guide?"
False,0,No u^
False,3,Everything now get to work
False,0,A list of legendary attributes for weapons and gear 
False,0,I know the feels bro
False,1,"I do too! Sorry I took a while. I don't care how clunky or bad it might look (like in Arma games) I will like it, I am tired of UI animations"
False,0,But I'm guessing by the lack of commenting I'm the only person who likes first person immersion
False,0,It'll make first person so much better instead of that quickly switching to third person for a second crap
False,0,"Oh, that's was simultaneous"
False,0,Woah! That and clunky 3d animations in first person. Not that UI perfecto looking animations.
False,0,With all the animations in first person aswell
False,0,That would be cool......maybe if we could build a custom wep from the ground up with a custom paint 
False,0,Be able to make golden and silver versions of upgrades so it uses those instead of aluminum and steel
False,0,Armored core style PA customization would be sweet 
False,0,It'd be great to have any colour of paint to use. 
False,0,I want to create a war paint machete type of deal
False,1,"Yeah, sounds cool. I want a red and dark Deliverer."
False,0,On rare occasions they will send a gum ship to kill you but you can just shoot the wings repeatedly until the wing catches on fire or you could use the missile launcher and blow it out of the sky
False,0,"Use an automatic armor piecing assault rifle. The big one. With a compensator, drum mag, recoil compensating stock, and a circle reflex sight. "
False,0,"Better stay close to Super Mutants. So far, I've seen they destroying Vertibirds easily."
False,0,"Not necessarily. They'll be hostile, but you don't need to take me down  "
False,0,I see them very often
False,0,"Bought it pretty cheap, couple hundred caps. Either diamond city or good neighbor, can't remember"
False,0,Railroad gave me a gauss rifle.
False,0,You da man Kyle thanks
False,1,The institute ends better. And you can get a special laser minigun (whatever they're called) from the attack on the BoS when with the institute 
False,1,Yeah I got the deliverer. I'm just now entering the institute. I planned on siding with them.
False,0,Side with the railroad till you get the deliverer. Then side with the BoS till you can side with the institute then do so. 
False,0,Cool thanks man. I been procrastinating with the main quest cause there's so much shit I wanna do everything.
False,0,Yup. Side with the institute and take bunker hill. There'll be a ton of gauss rifles on the railroad people 
False,0,Cool Story
False,0,The right one 
False,0,There isn't one you ubnlock the door via terminal
False,0,It's in one of the nearby houses. 
False,0,You find it
False,0,"Intelligence will allow you to pick locks and unlock terminals, which you have to do A LOT all through the game. Charisma is great for speech checks aka intimidation/persuasion. Everything else is based on your play style. I went with a high strength so that I can carry a lot of stuff and have high melee damage"
False,0,I chose randomly then when i was out of the vault I did the specials glitch with dogmeat... And before level 3 i had all my specials maxed :))
False,0,Pick you special points based on what perks you want early access to. 
False,0,I put 10 into Charisma. There are a fair amount of speech checks in this game.
False,0,Wear
False,0,Charisma for sure. Make it level 9 then were glasses till u get the bobblehead
False,0,"Start with 10 strength, 10 endurance and 4 luck, the rest are 1 :D"
False,2,"Intelligence and charisma. Charisma helps a decent amount over the expanse of the whole game, but it isn't as needed as strength and intelligence."
False,0,So do all the intelligence ones first?
False,0,Intelligence
False,0,To the exploits
False,0,I read turn off auto updates and uninstall it and install it again just refuse the update
False,1,Why? It improved game optimisation and performance. Fixed a few quest and miscellaneous glitches too. Why would you possibly want to remove it?
False,0,I don't know!! 
False,0,Elder Scrolls online is still pretty bad so let's hope not.
False,0,Bethesda already thought about it and they aren't going to do it cause it would take away from the experience they're trying to make
False,0,I'm not saying solely multiplayer. Just the option. 
False,0,Never
False,0,I don't think so... Anyways I like fallout single player 
False,0,You don't have to break down the objects. You can simply store them.
False,0,So do I have to break stuff down or can I leave a microscope in there and still get the components somewhere else
False,0,"Not objects like guns, armor, or clothing. Only materials."
False,0,"They should make it so that if you transfer materials of any sort to a toolbox or whatever, they would show up in any toolbox you look in..."
False,0,"Yes, but I don't think the materials you store in one settlement will show up in another settlement. Materials are shared while building though"
False,0,He won't bother
False,3,As long as he doesnt bother us he is fine
False,2,You're a homophobic bigot why would anyone listen to you?
False,0,*supporting*
False,0,"Me? I am supprting, he's badass"
False,1,Oh god... what have you done...
False,0,"You forgot to add no (kate shaw plz). But yeah, I agree"
False,4,I'm still here 
False,0,Like if you don't agree^
False,4,No.
False,0,I never had any of those problems but now it won't show me any info in the top left corner like the amount of cap stash or if I'm givin something. 
False,0,Aaaannd they fixed the cap glitch.......
False,0,University point 
False,0,Look it up on YouTube and you'll see a tutorial
False,0,Look it up on the wikia? Lol. I think jack cabot gives you it  
False,1,Early next year 
False,1,Xbox doesn't even deserve to be in existence......that is all
False,0,Never
False,0,Deacon is badass .. I had him as a companion and equipped some 26+ black ops armor and some ballistic weave clothing ... he kept sweeping enimies by the leg with his gun lol by far my favorite companion.
False,0,Does that happen even if he's been equipped with armor? 
False,2,Oh really? I was wondering where he got a lab coat. Haha 
False,0,"Could try reverse pickpocketing a grenade or a mine onto him? Might cause a change in his scripting or whatever, when he panics."
False,0,I had the same problem on ps4 but he was in a diner
False,0,You can't 
False,0,Wait you can't move caps out of your inv anymore?
False,0,Makes it hard to roleplay...
False,0,Can't 
False,0,Two shot combat rifle 😍 108 damage
False,0,"Explosive automatic combat shotgun.
You wanna talk about overpowered"
False,0,Wounding double barrel shotgun.....bleeding damage.....extremely useful for survival
False,0,VATS 10 MM is beast 
False,1,My babe i called defiance. A two shot gauss rifle
False,0,"^*

I always do that smh "
False,1,You can do that with the deliverer as well*
False,0,A 10mm that uses less ap and charges crits faster. I can empty a full click if my ap is full
False,0,A staggering fatman. So my enemies disintegrated skeletons will stagger a bit.
False,0,You have travel with them to have it
False,2,Oh shit it's permanent? I just got them for fun! Now it's just more of a reason to get them!
False,2,Permanent!
False,3,Permanent
False,0,👍
False,0,Neat
False,0,Cool.
False,0,Yeah. I deleted one of those broken down houses in Sanctuary and build a shack that holds all my power armor frames. I have like 20 in there.
False,0,Thanks ethanc
False,0,I bet u know all about that 
False,1,Try traveling away and back
False,0,Rape them. Hard.
False,0,"The only people are dr. Amari and the detective and im shur i cant kill them
"
False,0,Get out of comat mode by killing everyone 
False,0,Killed him with some nuke mines.
False,0,I just killed him at level 14 with melee perks. 
False,0,"Dude you can have a gun that is perfect with that version of power fist, a cryolator, or a freezing weapon, so when you do a critical and the enemy freezes just run up to them an smash them with the power fist. Until dead or un-frozen. It works really well because it dose more damage the more you hit. I've done it loads of times."
False,0,Swans hard to kill 
False,0,"Yeah it was a ""meh"" prize to me. I just wanted to kill him. I ran into him real early so I had to run away. But I came back with a vengeance!"
False,1,"The big one is the ammo for caps glitch at vendors. Then I think the rest was small, performance based stuff. "
False,1,Oh sorry that's the holocaust
False,2,Oooooh you're a nazi too? How much of a troll can you be
False,2,Systematic extermination of over 9 million Jews 
False,4,Stuff
False,0,The ones you buy from vendors will restock. 
False,0,Are the ones you buy limited ?
False,0,"Mind that you can scavenge around the map, as well as buying things "
False,0,"Yeah, you need to buy, scavenge or scrap from the settlement area."
False,0,U run out
False,0,"Good, that guy was a fuckwit."
False,0,Hes no longer there... Only me and my rifle now....
False,0,Lord have mercy.
False,0,Maybee. I just wish to torture raiders like they torture others......
False,0,You sick fuck.
False,0,Deathclaws do not support isis. They eat anyone with extreeme prejudice....
False,0,Thats why my armor has radiation upgrades.
False,0,I want to behead every Damn one of those little Isis supporting bastards
False,0,Not really lol. Or behemoth super mutants lol.
False,0,Your arse woud get radiation though
False,1,Ok i will dunno why this posted 2times tho lol
False,2,It's not like they're fapping...wait actually yeah. Ok have a good time
False,1,"Put a chair in a room, when they sit down, get rid of the door and put in a wall, put a fire trap in the room and activate it to kill them (idea from Robbaz)"
False,1,Teach them they are maggots. Build a bell gather all settlers. Execute one in front of them and remove all water and food... that will teach them
False,1,Take out the belt then
False,0,"Same thing happens when you upgrade to final level or Big Leagues perk for melee builds. My bat which did  112 damage before now only does 57. I read that it is only displayed wrong and it does do the correct amount of damage, but I had to reload and choose a different perk because thAt bothered me too much"
False,0,Because I had the same problem but the gun I had equipped did more damage the lower my Health 
False,0,If you have a gun that does more damage the lower you have and had it equipped it will show different damage because your health. 
False,0,What about that night and day time perk? Does that have an effect on damage?
False,0,I see it on my xbox too it goes up n down. I think its because of a bug or the items u wear in game or the chems ya take 
False,3,"I actually haven't used any of the guns yet since the display changed, so it might just be a display problem. Honestly, even if the damage went down, it would only be lowering by 10 to 20 or so points. Still extremely powerful."
False,1,Is it a display bug? Do you see an actual decrease on the weapon's performance?
False,0,Does it just show that as the damage? Or is it the actual damage done?
False,0,In fallout three my fave parts were the subwayS. They were so creepy lol 
False,0,Grill?
False,0,That was pretty random huh
False,0,Go die you Donald Trump supporter
False,1,Just because I'm a girl you think I'd like the mall too...
False,1,That's so sexist to say... reported.
False,0,Kill her
False,0,Don't why you would rob her in the first place
False,0,Ssj3 u got xbox
False,0,Just check the supply line article 
False,0,"Yes. Only one settler can go to one different settlement. Go into workshop mode and click LB (not sure what button for PS4 and PC) and then click the settlement they go to. Afterward, if you go to your pipboy map, you can click a button to see supply lines. The ones that connect will share materials throughout eachother."
False,0,Have you assigned a settler to a supply line between the castle and the settlement you want to share items with?
False,2,"You have to assign someone as delivery boy like i think

False,0,Makes sense 
False,0,He's laying low. Otherwise he'd get banned
False,0,"He, uhh (whispers) I think he's still around"
False,0,Illumugly confirmed
False,0,HOLY SHIT WHAT IFBHE WAS MUGLY!
False,0,What!? Can't wait to meet him if he/she decides to come back!
False,0,He is like Mugly 
False,0,Is that another Badass guy that no one likes?
False,0,He's a synth btw
False,0,Oh and that other courier. His names escapes me.
False,0,Yeah. I change my mind. THREE DOG!!!
False,0,"Whitechapel Charlie!!!
He sounds like Gordon Ramsay, but a Mr.Handy"
False,1,three dog. *he never said it had to be from fo4 😈
False,0,"He's cool. Preston is my dude. 

Besides them, I think my favorite npc is that Mr. Handy at the Sunshine Co-op. The one that sounds like a hippy. Unfortunately I waited to build that settlement and he disappeared 😢"
False,1,Radroaches
False,0,Melee and stealth and kinda op rn 
False,3,Ouch. Quick saving build is the best build
False,0,"Where the door to the science center is, check around there"
False,0,I think that's close to a catwalk in diamond city. The one that goes to the water plant of Mr. Clean
False,0,Did anyone's silver machine gun turn into a regular machine gun after you completed the mission? Mines gone and I got some junker in my inventory (I'm assuming it changed to normal after but I don't really know)
False,0,Okay thanks guys
False,0,N make sure kent doesnt die like he did on mine. Lol
False,0,"If you do the Silver Shroud mission, make sure you go back and grab the replica machine gun and script. I missed them and couldn't get the rewards afterwards."
False,2,thank you ☺️
False,1,Couldn't have said it better.
False,3,go to the memory den in good neighbor. go through the red door on the right and then you'll find a ghoul. I think his name is Kent. talk to him and he gives you the quest
False,0,Cool. Was worried.  Gonna try to make extravagant settlements at each of the big ones.
False,0,I made the update yesterday and this morning i was still able to do the settlement size glitch... So we are safe... For now...
False,0,"But if I do, I'll post something."
False,0,"Hahaha me too. If it is, I believe people on the PC have modded past it. So, theoretically, when mods come out, we should be able to get it. If someone creates it of course. Which I wouldn't know why they wouldn't."
False,0,If you find out please inform. That is the only thing im worried about
False,0,I don't think so. I was attempting to check it out before I actually downloaded it. I don't believe it did bit I could be wrong. It doesn't seem as big of a deal compared to a caps glitch. But I really don't know.
False,0,New Vegas wasn't made by Bethesda
False,0,I know lol it was a joke
False,0,"""That Gun"" it was the unique 12.77 pistol in new vegas and was meant to be Rick Deckards gun from Blade Runner. I think you bought it inside a dinosaur "
False,0,"Still. They bought back the ""waser wifle"" 😂😂"
False,0,What gun
False,1,It's a New Vegas thing
False,1,"I already got the ps4 one this morning. It was supposedly supposed to make the game run smoother and at more fps, but all it did for me was take out caps glitch "
False,0,I'm sorry to hear.
False,1,The patch for xbox one came out this morning :(
False,0,Ps4 patch came out yesterday Xbox one patch is coming out later this week
False,0,"I believe was patch was in pc, later was patch in was consoles "
False,0,What was system was the patch on
False,1,"Not updating then, I want to have fun sometimes not be fucked by the wasteland on all playthroughs. Thanks then"
False,1,"I find those all over the place lol 
Hidden stuff, legendary enemies, quests and side quests!?"
False,1,We buy cool weapons and armors.
False,1,What does everyone buy with all their caps?? I've got around 10k and not had to spend any yet lol might just save up and buy the mod'd fatman from diamond city
False,0,Do you mean the one with the vendors that glitch
False,0,I'm Mr.Toast
False,0,Caps glitch
False,0,I did it without him.. You make more caps
False,0,If you finish the main quest first he'll disappear. Happend to me. Meh whatever.
False,0,damnit
False,0,It's a glitch reload a precious save or no quest
False,0,will do 
False,0,Tell me what happens I don't have my PC w/ me right now
False,0,how did such an obvious possibility skip my mind lol I'm an ass 
False,0,Save n try it out :)
False,0,If Mario can become a freaking raccoon I should be able to become a Deathclaw 
False,0,Death claw helmet? Boots? Clothes? There should be a whole outfit. 
False,0,They should have a deathclaws head item just so i could use it instead of those lousy kickballs
False,0,I was just thinking that yesterday after killing a glowing one. I had to settle for a screen shot
False,0,They need to add pikes that you can place around your settlement. Any attackers killed in the green zone auto mount onto pikes to warn future attackers of the danger of messing with my settlements. 
False,0,Baileys gayyyyyy
False,0,These comments are getting down to the BONE!
False,0,Goodnight. <3
False,1,I cant.... Ever since the enclave showed up in fallout 3 with trained deathclaws ive always wanted my own..... Maybee even a yao guai.... Or 2.
False,0,You're disturbing on so many levels. Get those sick fucking Deathclaw fantasies out of your head Goslin.
False,0,To the infinity and beyond!!!
False,0,"Its 16,000"
False,0,264 i heard
False,0,I heard it like 1000. I know it takes like 240+ levels to max out your perks.
False,1,"The actual level, cheers😊"
False,2,As of like what's the highest legit level? Or asking about the levelcap? It is unlimited levels
False,0,Has cait asked you to go there yet? 
False,0,Just keep going through the Vault 
False,0,no
False,1,>_> *
False,1,"Wait.... Is this a riddle?

>.>"
False,1,"Sorry, I thought you said ""what would you buy"" but yeah set up the shops like the other guy said"
False,0,Radroach food
False,0,You gotta set up shops and assign people to them
False,1,Easy... go to google and search Fallout 4 patch notes. Apparently it is just performance fixes and glitch removal.
False,0,Any gun can essentially become a sniper rifle (if you believe enough). 
False,0,You can make a hunting rifle a .50 cal destroyer. Gun mods are great.
False,0,"Another, follow the Bedford railway away from diamond city, bring a companion you will come across two super mutants and a dog let ur companion take out the bomber super mutant and In a litter railway building/look out there will be the other super mutant kill him and the dog and get the sniper he was using, it's actually a good one to long light barrel night vision scope .50 ammo, rips at about 97 dmg if u just want an easy sniper to get "
False,0,"Rarely at low levels, better if you mod a hunting rifle. Or wait, you can get Reba II from salem. That's the Northeast part of the map (top right corner) really close to the museum of witchcraft. But beware of the mirelurks."
False,0,You can mod a hunting rifle into one. Or go to diamond city. They usually have one for sale. If not wait two days and try again. 
False,0,Put all your 100% ones in your work bench so you can use up all others .  I only carry 3 or 4 at a time and store all full ones until I run out
False,0,Thanks!👍🏻👍🏻
False,1,Yeah use the transfer menu
False,1,"If you only equip the one you want to use, that'll be the one you'll put in. You have to put all the ones you don't want to use (full ones) into a box or some container"
False,0,Just solved this by fast traveling to Libertaria or however you spell it 
False,0,Yas
False,0,Surprise cock fags
False,0,Dude! It shows up on the previous page!
False,2,OMG YOU RUINED IT ALL YOU DICKBREAD
False,0,"I know son, I forgive you."
False,1,Note: I said spoiler 😂
False,0,<3
False,2,Thanks for fucking ruining the ending of the storyline you pathetic fuck!
False,0,And I can finally kill Marcy and her brother
False,0,Then diamond city will truly be empty
False,0,And children and bitches and their brothers and...that's it for now.
False,0,"Okay so the quest marker should lead you to a wall with a deal next to it that says ""the freedoms trail"" which spins. Spin it so that the arrow on top spells out the word ""railroad"" (pushing the center button between each letter) and it will open "
False,0,"Oh! There's a thing on the wall that looks like a circular metal plaque that you can interact with. Rotate it and spell 'railroad' and the hidden door will open :)

You have to confirm each letter, by the way."
False,1,HAHAHAH NEVERMIND I GOT IT LOL
False,1,you see the spinning dial? spell railroad
False,0,Does it patch the settlement one for size of base
False,0,Yes. It patches the caps and ammo glitch.... among other things
False,1,It wasn't me I am innocent please don't hurt me.
False,0,Not me. I don't want to have a bad time.
False,0,"Guys SOMEONE KILLED MY BROTHER.




I'M GOING TO END WHOEVER DID THIS!
WHICH OF YOU DID IT!?"
False,0,Get off my fucking discussion.
False,0,"Well, I'm back. Did I miss anything?"
False,0,Anyone like laser and plasma guns they go pew pew pew pew pew pew pew then people head go squish and turn into a red mist.

False,0,"Except synths, I don't serve synths"
False,0,"""Communism is a good alternative... To death!!""

False,0,what?
False,1,Southwest of the Custom House Tower. Giant green building.
False,0,Just west of Custom House Tower.
False,1,Search it on this. it will give you a picture of the map with location.
False,0,Next the makeshift tower or whatever in the east middle ish of the map
False,0,I'm thinking about making it a huge fort 
False,0,Make a sweet island resort. If you put chairs and tables near a bar your settlers while hang out around it at night
False,0,Nah itll smell
False,0,Make brahmin island

False,0,The legion or institute 
False,0,"I'd say the BoS,I sided with them in every game and I've been loving them ever since Fallout 1, back then they were the only accrual force,and they were friendly enough. "
False,0,NCR allday baby
False,0,"Raiders. Because Fuck you that's why.  

On another note
I think every faction is a dick in fallout four. They all want each other dead. But it goes really well with the war never changing theme. "
False,0,"Yeah I'm having trouble siding with the BoS nowadays. They seem like dicks.

Powder gangers. Really? Why?"
False,1,Powder gangers
False,2,Throughout my fallout gaming career I've always sided with the brotherhood not just for power armour but for just the way they operate and weapons 
False,2,"Radrodeo: best place for radroaches to hang out.
Share food
They tickle you with their pointy legs when they climb on you (as long as you have clothe...otherwise be sure to have a stimpack at hand)
Free rooms at the price of a finger nail (toenails are preferred)

False,0,I had almost 50 pounds of chems because I thought they still weighed nothing
False,0,"Recovering Psychojet addict here. Children, chems are bad. But if you must do them I suggest looking into the quest Diamond City Blues and using the Chem Station to mix chems for more powerful chems"
False,1,This tip was brought to you by the atomic wrangler
False,2,This tip was brought to u by a junkie
False,4,Another helpful tip. Wear armor. It's helpful when you don't want to take damage.
False,0,And then that buzz afterwards...
False,0,Jet is pretty sweet
False,0,"Radiation, sugar bombs, and regular bombs."
False,0,And a bowl of sugar bombs
False,1,I love the smell of radiation in the morning.
False,2,He didnt ... He was gonna win a pack of steak knives (words from himself ingame ) find him in good neigbor hotel
False,1,Even overseers can be pawns. Forget which vault but if you read the terminals they got some moron to be overseer and be an asshole to rich people. Best. Promotion. Ever. 
False,1,Yeah.... steak knives....
False,3,He only did it because he would win a pack of steak knives according to him as a ghoul. 
False,1,Yeah the Vault Tec guy apologizes I think
False,1,"The overseer was like a puppet government for vaults. He was there, he was seen as the authority, but the true decision makers were the staff of social experiments. "
False,1,Only the staff involved and the overseer was ever told of the social experiments that went on in any of the vaults. 
False,2,They only tell the scientists and the Overseers. And sometimes they don't even tell the overseer
False,0,I uninstalled it cuz I like the exploitation dlc come out I'm not updating
False,0,Got never-ending laser rifle from a legendary. And also the limitless one from university point.
False,0,Laser pistol =limitless potential the legendary gun
False,0,Is M-m-m-mayonaise an instrument? ?
False,0,All I got was a stupid pipe pistol 
False,0,But it was the An-94 from blops 2 
False,1,I have 4 or 5. Not sure what I did with them
False,1,My friend has the best rng and got it on his assault rifle
False,2,The double barrel shotgun that just keeps shooting no reloading button bash rt and its like a full auto shotgun.
False,2,Don't question my logic! 
False,0,?
False,0,Yeah it's op for me. When I found it I nodded it just a bit and it did 120 base damage for me at level 23 
False,0,I used it as a sniper rifle for a while haha. It was fun
False,0,For me it's OP af
False,0,My gaus rifle is my best friend. It's fully upgraded. I Fuck people up with it. Survival too 
False,2,I agree. With max rifle man perk and sneak dmg.  This thing is to strong. Easily kill anything in one hit. 
False,0,No worries.
False,0,"No shit really, I'll try that out thanks man "
False,2,You should invest in the rifleman perks and all that. I don't know too much about it. Some people get over 450 damage because of the perks
False,0,It took almost 4 to kill a raider like what is this 
False,0,It's pretty meh to be honest. Oh wow! A gun that can almost kill everything with one shot.
False,0,Another good point ☺
False,0,I did. It's good that we have a voice actor but what if I want an african american character or a chinese character? The voice doesn't fit with many character creations.
False,0,It sure sounded like it.
False,0,I dont think he was
False,1,Hahaha thanks? I was just double checking. I've never personally come across one. So I wasn't sure. You don't need to be condescending about it.
False,0,"Again, we already came to that conclusion but you're good for helping out "
False,1,Yes. You definitely can. I just read someone saying that they got a Super Sludge that had Freezing damage on it. Another that talked about a baseball bat. Now it's just the luck of the draw. Goodluck man.
False,0,Stealth serrated combat knives are super good for that. So is the shishkebab 
False,0,Me nether but I'm trying a ninja build
False,0,The answer is yes anyways 
False,0,I'm just not into Melee at all on any Fallout. I carry one for fun but that's it. I know they drop ones that a poisonous. I think some that catch people on fire. But I can attempt to look it up real fast.
False,0,It can. Yes thanks that's all I needed to hear
False,0,You need to pick up a little red cylinder that has the cure in it. It's kind of hard to tell what's needed on the big table full of junk.
False,0, I think it's actually called Med Tec Reseach. But what are you trying to do there? A quest?
False,0,What's the building called 
False,0,"Yep. You can destroy any faction you want, really. It all depends on who you side with "
False,0,Thanks then
False,0,there isn't a quest to destroy them. I think. but you can just kill em all on your own
False,0,I bet I can't
False,0,Hmm I see... what about the minutemen? Can I destroy them too? They seem really soft.
False,0,I think you can do it with the minutemen if you have the castle and the brotherhood hates you
False,0,"Spoiler alert ahead.               



If u side with the institute u go up there destroy a beacon and kill 2 turrets and protection then u can destroy The prydwen "
False,1,I have seen it but don't know if it dose anything it might be what ingrum and the others used to get to the prydwen while you blew up the institute 
False,1,There'll be BoS that spawn there sometimes afterwards 
False,1,Actually it does exist 
False,1,It does exist with the pyrdwen beautifully crashed against the earth
False,1,No. I haven't. Is there any cool loot in there?
False,0,I hate all the halo games.
False,0,"Completed it in a day due to having the ""no save glitch"". Nothing fantastic, just another 4 in my opinion."
False,0,Love it but I'm the biggest halo fangirl ever
False,0,Halo 5 was terrible
False,0,It's alright. That game was only a way to waste time until Fallout came out.
False,0,"Angry Joe...











Does not"
False,0,It doesn't Rlly matter they didn't make any real changes
False,0,It would come out everywhere at the same Time. ^
False,0, I'm not. But I would guess it wild come out everywhere when I does cone out. But again I'm not sure.
False,0,Lol yeah man my games crashed out at least 2 dozen times lol
False,0,That's always happened from time to time. It happens with all Bethesda games pretty much (all fallouts by Bethesda and games of the sort)
False,0,KILL YOURSELF YOU FUCKING ROBO ASS NIGGER
False,0,Mr handy only has 3 arms wtf
False,0,Lol wut is happening here
False,0,Whatever your into. I converted years ago.
False,1,I sexually identify as a deathclaw
False,0,It takes a real robot to do what you just did. Im so horny im about to fry a circuit. 
False,1,"Don't worry, you're... ""Special""."
False,0,Is that your pet name for yourself when you cry and jack yourself to sleep? 
False,0,I cri everytime some one calls me a robo! Which is extremely offensive when I am Mr.Handy please guys stop the racism
False,1,RIP eye users
False,0,You are guessing correct
False,0,But it's only available in certain power armour like T60 is bos t51 is railroad and t45 is minutemen so I'm guessing x01 is institute 
False,0,Yep
False,0,Word that's what I was going for. Thank you 
False,0,I got all the paints except the institutes and I chose the bos
False,0,"Okay ty, anyone else know?"
False,0,I think you can only get that if you choose them. but not completely sure cuz I sided with the institute
False,0,you can buy tinker tom's unique weapon from him 
False,0,What about the armor paint?
False,0,ballistic weave
False,0,Or try reinstalling the update if you can
False,1,maybe try quitting the game and restarting your console or pc 
False,0,BONE-A-RAMA!
False,0,BONARATION!!!!!
False,0,If we stop posting we will all be BONED.
False,1,This is bonerific
False,0,I'm part of the boning commission 
False,1,HIGHWAYYYY TOO THE BONING ZONE!
False,0,I uninstalled it and I'm gonna refuse to update it til a dlc comes out
False,0,Ya it was patched for ps4 too and I have spent so much time in game that I can't remember how to delete the update *single tear*
False,0,Damnit! Time to wait a few days and some one will find one
False,0,No
False,0,Fuck man anyway u uninstall the update
False,0,unless you didn't update
False,0,Yes.
False,0,"damn that sucks , hope it fixes "
False,0,Yeah dude just go back to save before that lol that's kinda creepy
False,0,Wow. I don't know. Did you try replaying the Fort Strong mission? That's where I would start.
False,0,I'd just check with the vendor at Dimond City that sells clothes.
False,0,It's a vanity piece. It's random like finding a tuxedo or dirty tan suit 
False,0,"Instructions not clear, I got slapped because of asking."
False,0,"invite her to play!!! then you can have her sit in your lap and show her the controls and stuff 
I'm cheesy like that ✌️"
False,0,I use The Deliverer because that's how I imagine The Silver Shroud... Hidden in the shadows... Not letting the villains know he's there... But if you want a legit SS get his Silver Submachine Gun
False,0,Bruh .44 end of discussion.  Thing rips holes threw these chums
False,0,And the 44 pistol...good idea.
False,0,She's also easy to fall in love with 😍
False,0,"Damn...I forgot about the machine gun. OK. New idea...machine gun and hand trow explosives. Sneak and chem. Preferably home made explosives..never explored that part of the game. I think there is a perk for that. There..problem solved. 
Hmm...do sneak bonus apply to explosives?"
False,0,Cait don't mind chems 
False,0,Haha yeah roll with Valentine! That would be the perfect companion. I'm pretty sure he doesn't mind chem usage either. I could be wrong
False,0,But I've been wearing the silver shroud costume since I got it. It's the best armor in my opinion.
False,0,"That, and maybe a .44 pistol. You detective style. Plus I'd roll with Dogmeat until you come across Valentine. It only makes sense."
False,1,"Getting into the who idea of an RPG, huh? Hahaha no good for you man. I usually make up my own little back story. 

Anyway get that Silver Machine Gun. I missed my opportunity to get it. But you just have to give that guy the fake one you find at the comic book store."
False,0,Exactly! I just do that settlement size cap exploit to clear up space with  my extra guns. Yeah but I just made a few trips to like the Boston Technical High School or the Wilson Atomatoys Factory. Places I know have a lot of junk. I tried to keep places like that in mind.
False,0,Not a bad plan! I've been picking up things like vacuum tubes and any technology oriented items and scrapping them when I get back to my settlement. I do that with weapons that I don't use as well to get materials for mods and such. No real reason to have 15 10mm pistols. 
False,0,"Yeah that's how I feel about shipments of wood. What I did to get alot of Copper, screws, etc. was get Strong, get some power armor (I upgraded the legs so I can carry like 460) and I also had strong back so I could fast travel while over encumbered. Then I go to place that have replayable enemies and just grab everything! Oh and I had that perk that let my companions carry more. "
False,0,Kinda like The Truman Show...
False,1,You know what would be cool... If they made a DLC that leads you to a preserved pre-war city/worldspace where no one knows about the war and that think they're still in good old Pre-War USA... And then you have to uncover the dark secrets of this place... Wouldn't that be incredible? A little like Alexandria in TWD... where ppl are oblivious of what it's like outside...
False,1,"I'm hoping they are as big as the DLCs they let out for Skyrim. Love the game, but it's lacking things I can't quite put my finger on. I know in Skyrim on both DLCs Bethesda released quite a few new weapons and a whole bunch more map, and a few other things. I'm hoping they do the same for fallout"
False,0,Yeah. I was just curious.
False,0,Probably like new vegas the story continues after you beat the game the main thing about broken steel was it let you play after you beat the game
False,0,I'm guessing mix of both. Like in FO3 there were the add ins with Broken Steel being an end - game thing.
False,0,Glitches and fps drops
False,0,I heard it just fixes the glitch that makes you able to never run out of room in settlements 
False,0,Thx 
False,1,Did they cap the settlement size glitch?
False,0,Yup
False,0,Yes sir
False,0,Institute. 
False,0,Ad Victoriam!
False,0,Railroad it is thanks
False,0,"You can side with both. No matter who you side with BoS/Institute/Railroad, the Minutemen will always like you. They're there as a back up if you anger everyone else"
False,0,And why
False,0,Railroad 
False,0,Kill both... Kill all
False,0,Neither
False,0,Since when is one month considered a few months...
False,1,"But wouldn't alot of people get Fallout 4 for Christmas? I think you still should. It's common courtesy. It only takes a few seconds. I'll admit I'll say something that I forget is a spoiler, but I don't do it on purpose. "
False,0,"Most of the new whiney people are gone, and the game is a few months old now. I'd say it's getting close to safe without hearing 1,000 crybabies"
False,0,I'll stop after January 6
False,0,Yep. I'm done.
False,0,In the Spanish translation the quote goes like 'you had no childhood if you never killed someone with a teddy bear' 
False,0,"The broadsided one is even better :""The Broadsider is the answer to that age long question. Would it be fun to walk around and kill enemies with a portable naval cannon. Yes,yes would."
False,0,Cacaopooporama?
False,0,A pussy taco
False,0,Pussy
False,0,Taco?
False,0,"Ammo one still works because I just did it and so does the settlement size one 
"
False,0,Great thanks!
False,0,It's good to see that I'm not getting any negative comments so far.
False,2,Well it's 11:43pm on 12/8 and I can tell you as of now the cap/ammo glich works.  
False,1,"As far as I know the ammo one isn't patched completely. Some ammo types seem to work. Often fast travelling away and back makes them work again. However, I have noticed that you no longer obtain the ammo you glitch. The vendor will not keep the ammo forcing you to purchase it back from them.

I recommend giving whichever ammo type you intend to glitch to your companion before performing the glitch. If you glitch ammo that you're carrying, the negative value will take from your ammo stocks. I lost over 10000 caps worth of plasma, so I learned the hard way.

Best approach is to only glitch ammo that in total is worth less than the total cap count of the vendor so you can use their caps to purchase the ammo without running at a loss. Eg. If .308 rounds in total cost 550 caps and the vendor only has 300 caps, this glitch will cost you 250 caps (if you intend on keeping the .308 rounds). If .45 rounds only cost 200 caps, you will make a 100 cap profit.

Hope this helps those who are having trouble with the glitch."
False,1,"No one needs to be roasting me if these glitches are patched lol. They can just go back and look at the detail, grammar, and description of all the glitches that I wrote about. That post took a long time lol."
False,0,"Yeah, I never did the ammo glitch because the cap glitch makes up for it. In my opinion... lol "
False,1,"Oh I am not doubting that, it's just ""people"" nothing agaisnt you  or them just common things"
False,1,Ik that the ammo one is patched
False,1,I don't think the infinite settlement size works anymore but the rest do
False,0,Fucking cannabis 
False,0,Lmfao
False,2,And dynamite goes the bomb
False,2,Boom*
False,0,"I just avoid all my settlements, if they have a problem with somebody I suggest they grow a pair and deal with it ."
False,0,"As with all the repeatable quests for all the factions, they will make sure there are two or three in your queue all the time.  As soon as you complete them, more will immediately be issued.  Just as in the BOS Cambridge Police quests, though you can fortunately avoid getting those.  I was sad at this decision by Bethesda.  I'd love to see settlements stop generating quests if you meet certain conditions, such as defense points.  Of course, I'd also love it if Wiseman, or the Abernathys, who have both said ""I'll never forget what you did for us"" would stop saying ""Are you from the minutemen?"" when I stop by the fortresses they now live in to hear about their latest complaint.  :)"
False,0,"Yes your right. Same ones over and over. So annoying
"
False,0,"That's not right because I'm averaging that many every night. It's one after the other. I'd like to take my Fatman and blow that damn hat off his head lol
"
False,0,i hate how he repeats quests sometimes. like ive had the ghouls problem at Abernathy farms 4 times
False,0,He only has like 4 quests and then he's done
False,0,I want to kill him
False,0,I believe that there are a couple quests in 81. Cause you gotta meet Curie and save the boy (or not)
False,0,Is there a quest to do in vault 81?
False,2,"get the overseers guardian in vault 81. it shoots an additional projectile
but when you're exploring it's mostly random unless it's a unique weapon"
False,0,I have a Fat Man that shoots two mini nukes but only consumes one per shot. I believe I got it from Arturo in Diamond City.
False,0,You're actually playing dayz. Rip your shirt and use as bandage
False,0,reload last save?
False,0,After quiting and reloading twine it stopped thanks
False,0,I've walking in and out a few times I've even emptied out my inventory
False,0,"Go through a door that is a loading screen, its a bug I believe"
False,0,Well shit. Guess I'm not getting it then.
False,0,"But seriously, it is called ""Deliverer"""
False,0,"Yes, it is called ""Deliverer"" and I don't know how many people dieded to it...badumtsss. You didn't get it? I will jump out then"
False,0,Yep. It's a quest reward if you help the Railroad 
False,0,If u do mama murphys mission u give her a shit ton of chems n she croaks. Like a old bat lol
False,0,https://youtu.be/evQeYKUyL18
False,0,There should be a death claw one
False,0,Apparently you can make her OD.
False,0,"What if you give her like 100chems
She should die right..?"
False,0,Maybe they should let us kill mama murphy
False,0,She's not worth it.
False,0,Maybe riding mama murphy
False,0,Maybe a super mutant.
False,0,Thats what oberland is for
False,0,I never got in... That's how good it is
False,0,You didn't build it well
False,0,Breaks out 
False,0,Sends cayd
False,0,In new Vegas? 
False,0,Fog Machines. We need fog machines for our settlements.
False,0,Rave
False,0,"Sure, why not? Just don't steal my power armor and I'm fine with it."
False,0,Can I live there?  Please?
False,0,I was thinking you could make a Mr. Handy or two at each settlement. Just because I found  Handy the box at Sanctuary Hills.
False,0,You can shoot explosive cats out of fat mans
False,2,Of course mods do that. Mods can do anything.  You can ride a toilet around while looking like Mike Tyson with mods.
False,0,Console peasant nerd scrub

False,0,I was a huge fan of Fallout 2 and NV and since the release of Fallout 4 I wanted help and share information with fellow fans
False,0,Just to inform about FO3 and FNV and to learn.
False,0,Well my crew keeps getting cut down by this vault guy so I got plenty of time on my hands... So lonely... So cold.

False,0,"Railroad is the most good moral from all the factions.

BOS just destroys everything pretty much but you get some good gear and power armor from them plus I heard it's the most fun.

Minutemen obviously they wanna do good for the commonwealth. But they don't care for synths.

False,0,Well I've killed a few railroad agents attacking bos outpost and they had 2 of the 5
False,1,"Anytime, Ad Victoriam"
False,1,Okay thanks
False,1,"When you kill legendary enemies they drop gear with a special perk ( legendary gear had the star). You can wear these pieces over certain pieces of clothes. I was running with bos under armor, with a raider right arm, combat chest, metal left arm, raider right leg and synth left leg. Piecemeal just means putting together whatever you got. The important part is that each piece of gear is legendary and gives me an extra dmg resistance perk. "
False,0,Okay thanks mate but what is piecemeal and how do I do it
False,1,Seem to be out of luck with the ballistic weave. ( don't worry me too) another good idea is to just get legendary gear and piecemeal it over something. Make sure to upgrade them. Also there's great Perks in the endurance tree.  Im running around in the silver shroud outfits and I'm doing pretty well on survival.
False,0,I've already finished and sided with the BOS
False,2,"Alright first off this is easy peasy. Spoilers 





Play the railroad long enough to get the quest for the first Dia cache. Once completed tinker Tom will give you the ability to use ballistic weaving. Now with that done grab these 2 basic clothes, army/military (depending on what special bonus you like) and the news boy cap. Once that's done you can mod both of those with ballistic weave at at mk.5 (lv 4 armourer) you get 110 physical and energy resistance. Those two pieces give 220 total. Now once that's done just grab your fave looking armour set like metal or combat and wear that. My heavy combat set gives me around a total of 330 physical and energy resistance and we'll as the BoS paint which gives 75 radiation resistance. Other than that I'm not sure of anything else that beats that set up besides power armour it's self. "
False,1,Look towards the railroad. I believe they have bioweave. Makes armor super strong
False,0,"Thanks. I kept doing them 1 for 1 order just so I wouldn't get too far ahead in any one alliance.

False,0,Yes i ran into a few of them when the enclave came in at the end of f3. They would come with enclave officers.... It was very tough when you would fight them because they would also have power armor troops with them.

False,0,"Siding with the Minutemen leads to a planned attack on the Prydwen airship, shooting it down with artillery from multiple directions. Though the Prydwen gets destroyed, the Brotherhood of Steel refuses to go down without a fight. As the Prydwen falls, several hostile Vertibird gunships come straight toward the Castle. You must take up arms with your fellow Minutemen to defeat what remains of the Brotherhood once and for all. 

Once the Brotherhood of Steel is defeated, the Minutemen focus their attention on destroying the Institute. This involves betraying Father and planting a charge on a nuclear reactor that will destroy the Institute from the inside. Since the Minutemen become allied with the Railroad faction, several Synths are recovered from the Institute in the process. Afterward, the Railroad quests remain available, and the Commonwealth is free to settle their communities peacefully. Although this doesn’t seem to be a very ‘neutral’ way to go about these events, siding with the Minutemen may nevertheless be the easiest ending to achieve. "
False,0,"The Minutemen Ending
The Minutemen essentially want a chance to rebuild their communities and thrive in the Commonwealth. Thus, the Minutemen faction is considered mostly neutral, as no other faction seems to have an issue with them throughout the game. However, if you choose to side with the Minutemen after completing Act II, you will become allied with the Railroad faction, forcing you to take up arms against both the Institute and the Brotherhood of Steel.

False,0,"I never use the power armor unless it's a radiation issue though, I feel like it's such OP "
False,0,"Oh I definitely do play it backwards, although I don't have xo1 yet I did buy a Atom Cat suit of T60 and followed a BoS member after he crashed in the vertibird around for 15 minutes until he died to steal his T61b suit. Plus the T51 part I found in The Dig mission and T45 at start, I should start a Power Armor shop 😂"
False,0,And before some smart ass decides to make a comment about the set you get right at the start with the desthclaw I sold it for caps because I'm greedy lol
False,0,"I wouldn't worry dude. Some douche was posting the ending over and over last week >.> but I totally get what you mean with the armour lol, although the first set I actually got was the xo1 from the roof of that building with the sentry not and assaultron guarding it haha sins then I have got a t-60 and t-45, I feel like I play this game backwards sometimes lol "
False,0,"I won't spoil that for you then 😁 but I just feel it makes the end game more equal instead of worrying about dying all the time or getting a piece of armor that makes you go ""wow I really could of used this 10 levels ago"" "
False,0,What can I say lol. My son can wait. He wouldn't be able to even remember me anyways lol he was so young *tear*

False,0,obviously. how the fuck have people not caught on before this...? 
False,0,I think fallout 4s story was a bit short
False,0,Witcher 3 had good storey line 
False,1,"They do mention the first 2 fallouts in new vegas, but only because that's where they took place. Fallout 3 and 4 are on the other side of the country so there's not going to be many references. There is a great story in this fallout just have to pay attention to detail. I think one of the reasons people think there's a lack of story is because there's no cut scenes like on other games except for the beginning and ""end"", and that to get the full scope of the story you HAVE to talk to people and not just skip everything they say. Other words to learn the full story requires a lot of patience. Which no one seems to have."
False,0,S/O to the last of us ^
False,1,"What do you mean ""it isn't at movie level"", many games do manage to have a good story... Woah right? "

False,0,You buy it off Geneva for 2000 caps.
False,0,Pretty much.
False,0,"Great article,  I enjoyed it alot good post."
False,0,"TrueRavenclaw616: That's just bandwagoning. Every EU hater knows that EU was the big convoluted mess full of bland characters and continuity errors, and they are all glad it is gone. And there are Vongs in it, what a mess, and they killed Chewie!"
False,1,"I wish it were canon, but I'd be willing to accept it being non canon if and only if new books, like the sword of the jedi trilogy, continued to be made, and I won't read or watch anything from the new canon until they are. I also find it annoying when people complain about the EU but can't find examples to back up their claims."
False,0,Episode 7 will conflict with some of the stories though if they keep it.
False,1,I consider the old EU canon
False,1,You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting.
False,2,I have my own cannon
False,1,"Well, everything has its pros and cons. At least I will save some money :p"
False,1,"Nothing to really do about it. Push forward. Plus, even in New books they are referring to some EU making some EU, canon? Let's not lose all hope just yet. "
False,1,"I don't mind making everything after ROTJ non-canonical. Everything else should just be considered what they are, stories within the Star Wars universe that may or may not be 100% accurate."
False,1,"I'm fine with it. I always thought of the entire EU as pretty much how Disney redefined it; a lot of it holds truth, but is no longer the official story. So it's all essentially well-informed fanfiction, and I'm fine with that. It allows us to choose what parts we believe are true to the history (cuz let's be honest, there are A LOT of plot holes between sources, so making it Legends really cleans that up) and reject the stuff we don't like as not having happened, at least until Disney covers it or a new EU source is made canon. Remember, Disney and Lucasfilm never said they'd stop recognizing EU material as canon, just that they're pretty much starting with a clean slate."
False,1,Maybe he is Lea and Han's son. JJ Abrams might have been inspired by EU. Maybe he's based off Darth Caedus. Trained by Luke then turned to the dark side. It might be Obi-Wan and Anakin all over again.
False,0,Bantha fodder.
False,0,Adam Driver 
False,0,Kylo is han and Lea long lost son. Rai is there daughter. JJ be pulling I am your brother.

False,0,"Thanks again, I'll have to check that book out also."
False,0,And it is Canon. 👽👍🏻
False,0,"Outside of the Force Awakens Journey and Aftermath, A New Dawn is a great book. It captures the pure escence of the Empire and it is a great book for people interested in Star Wars Rebels..."
False,0,Sounds great. Thanks for the info.
False,0,"I'll be getting that too (I love Alan Dean Foster). In canon, I really like Lords of the Sith, Lost Stars, and Battlefront: Twilight Company. Also, at the end of March, a book by Claudia Gray (the author of Lost Stars) comes out and will serve as a tie-in to TFA. I'm greatly anticipating that."
False,0,Is there any new good books worth reading then?ill end up getting the Force Awakens book. There's usually different things and more details in the book.
False,0,"Yeah, I really liked Allston's books. Hopefully some new authors will be able to fill in his shoes."
False,0,It's a little slow going. I was hoping it would be like Betrayal or the other books of that series.
False,0,"Of the canon novels, Heir to the Jedi and Aftermath are my least favorite. HTTJ didn't really capture Luke's character, and the lack of villain made the plot a little thin imo. What do you think so far?"
False,0,"However, I really liked Rae Sloane, the flashbacks/PTSD moments, and the interlude segments. Also, Norra being retconned into Return of the Jedi gave me an excuse to rewatch the Battle of Endor. No complaints there!"
False,2,"I can't speak for others, but I disliked the majority of characters, I felt the plot was uninteresting, and I didn't care for the present-tense writing style. It's the first in a trilogy and just couldn't really stand on its own. I also know a large number of people disliked it because they thought it would tie into Episode VII, and it doesn't really do that."
False,0,"Agreed, Robot Chicken is to die for."
False,1,"Robot chicken, bonus material in star wars box set."
False,0,"New question! For any of the fights listed above, who do you think would win and why?"

False,1,Emperor Vitiate and Darth Sidious
False,1,Darth Maul and Mace Windu
False,0,"I'm unaware of any literature, and only know a little about the old Republic side of things. I get  the impression on here that post Return of the jedi material is not particularly good"
False,0,"The Thrawn trilogy, Darth Maul: Shadow hunter, Vision of the future. "
False,0,"Lost Stars, A New Dawn, and Splinter of the Mind's Eye."
False,0,"Are you new to the EU? Because if so, I'd recommend the Thrawn trilogy as a starting place. I don't know anything about the new canon though."
False,1,The thrawn trilogy
False,1,All the old republic 
False,1,Darth Bane trilogy. Darth Plagueis. The rise and fall of Darth Krayt.
False,1,"Han Solo trilogy. Loving it! Survivor's Quest and Traitor are great, too."
False,0,"Species that don't grow hair tend to use analogs for braids, which tend to be fairly standardized by species. Ahsoka demonstrated this with the traditional Togrutan silka bead braid. "
False,0,"The braid signifies them as a Padawan. When they are ""knighted"" it is traditional for their master to remove the braid with a lightsaber. The braid is then a keepsake and reminder. Anakin gave his braid to Padmae after it was cut off."
False,0,"Well never mind lol I would think it grows out as they go through the training before trials and all that. Ashoka tano has like a braid, but its a bead necklace"

False,0,I thought Aftermath was pretty awesome. 
False,1,"In the new canon, Lords of the Sith, Lost Stars, and Battlefront: Twilight Company are my favorite novels."
False,1,I heard star wars force unleashed is a good comic 
False,0,"^By ""tiers of canon"" I was referring to G-canon, T-canon, C-canon, etc., but your post is still true."
False,0,"Canon, non-canon, EU, non-canon in EU... There are many layers. For example, if there's a story about Ezra finding Superman, it is non-canon, because it features Rebels character. It can't be EU non-canon, because Ezra is official Dysnei canon. Do you understand, padawan?
For EU non-canon, Revan being female is the example."
False,1,The tiers of canon apply only to Legends (the official continuity before April 2014).
False,0,"Last time I checked there are actually different levels of canon, see canon article on this wiki."
False,0,Thanks! :D
False,2,"Canon is the official story of Star Wars. This includes the Episodes, The Clone Wars and Rebels TV shows, and any books/comics released after April 2014. Non-canon is anything that is not a part of Canon."
False,0,"The people that label the genres usually base their decision on past books by the author. Though Claudia Grey aimed it for Young Adults, it was more of a classic Star Wars story. So far it is my favorite canon novel. Definitely worth the read in my opinion"
False,0,"Still reading Battlefront, but I haven't had much time with finals coming up."
False,0,"@AV. . , better than Battlefront?"
False,1,My favorite new canon Star Wars novel. Don't let the YA label scare you away from it.

False,0,Plagieus could use the force to become immortal. But after reviving a person (or himself) to much in a short amount of time it would stop working. His apprentice (the emperor killed him in his sleep during episode 1. But the question is did he really did?

False,0,I think. I could be horrendously wrong there  
False,0,He is the supreme leader of the new order 
False,0,Some people are saying that snoke is Darth plagues
False,0,"Also, I like the forum too. Kinda sick of the Person vs Person posts though"
False,0,"Because of where Darth Raven fits in the timeline, it is unlikely that he is DR, and since KOTOR is no longer canon, he doesn't exist. If their is a nod to him, it will be a behind the scenes nod"
False,0,"And BTW, I also appreciate the lack of ""junk"" on this forum."
False,0,I feel like it's a slight nod to the KOTOR but I think it's just to show his some sort of Vader enthusiast 
False,0,"For those of you with the ""Jar Jar is a sith"" theory, it kinda looks like a gungan head."
False,0,"Well, it's highly inspired by Revan, but it's a nod to Vader. They don't care about KOTOR fans."
False,0,Literally cried.

False,0,"The empire wasn't perceived as evil. They were portrayed as though they were making a difference in the galaxy. And personally, I don't think that the empire was evil, it was however led by evil and those who followed his orders did so with the belief they were good. "
False,0,"The empire seems evil from our perspective, but people in the STAR WARS universe don't necessarily see it that way."
False,1,"In Disney's Rebels TV series and Jason Fry's Servants of the Empire novellas, the Empire sets up a vast network of Imperial Academies including one on the Outer Rim world of Lothal. The Lothal Imperial Academy is a junior one-year academy that takes teenagers. There are also senior academies like the Arkanis Academy. There are also officer training academies run by the Imperial Army, Navy, and Stormtroopers. Most of the clones have died out. Most of the recruits are patriotic human boys and girls. It is unclear if the Empire is still xenophobic but Jason says that it is no longer misogynistic. "
False,1,"Some were conscription I think, especially form the outer rim and mid rim worlds."
False,2,"When Palpatine took over, it was slowly and legitimately. When the Empire was born, Palpatine was at the height of his popularity. The Clone Wars were over, the Galactic economy was on the rise, life was good for many citizens. It wasn't until a good decade after that people started realizing that the empire wasn't such a good idea. Even Han was trained as a pilot in the Imperial Navy. 
So aside from the various clones, the majority of people who were Stormtroopers by BBY were just very patriotic citizens. One of Leia's notes in ""The Imperial Handbook"" states that most members of the Scout regiment were actually in it for the adventure and had no idea what the info they gathered was being used for."
False,2,"Well, I would say that the type of people that would enlist would either be: people trying to make a little money for their family, really patriotic patrons, people that crave action and war, and people that were forced to join the Empire."
False,1,"Well, the Empire kept on producing clones, and this can be seen in the book Allegiance by Timothy Zahn (Great book). This took place in 0 ABY, and in it he says he hated when humans enlisted, and said he preferred using clones instead. No need to spoil it further. 

Anyways, majority of the enlistee's that joined the Empire were patriotic young adults from the core, reason for this was because the core worlds were where Imperial citizens had it good and didn't see the atrocity of the Empire. 

Vader's 501st consisted of the best stormtroopers (both clones and non clones throughout the Imperial Stormtrooper Corps). "
False,1,pretty much anyone. the only pure clones in the empire was the 501st which was basically vaders body guards
False,0,"Aftermath is a highly, first installment of a trilogy,  anticipated glorified fan fiction novel written by the great author no one's heard of, Chuck Windig. The best thing about the book, is that the cover would make a cool poster.

False,0,Probably intentional
False,0,"Once in rewatching ROTJ during the ""major"" moment between L&L outside of the Ewok village, I wondered why Christiansen and Portman catch so much flack when that scene and other L&L scenes where as bad if not worse . . .

So, much like McGregor did an amazing job of ""playing Alex Guinness"", is there a chance Lucas wanted Hayden and Natalie to take from Hammel and Fisher dialogues as well?

Or am I just reaching and to lazy to look up the answer?"
False,0,"Bane brings up a good point, but I gotta agree with TK. The only reason Vader doesn't use force lightening is because he'll short out. However, Vader could block it with his lightsaber."
False,1,Count dodgy would electrocute him and his suit would stop working
False,1,Darth Vader's Djem So style only got better since his fight with dooku so Vader wins easily. Especially when you take into account that Vader incorporated makashi (dooku's form) into his own.

False,0,Someone once said that he brought balance by experiencing both sides of the force and choosing the light in the end.
False,0,"I always saw the title ""Return of the Jedi"" as Anakin returning to being a Jedi at the end of the movie but so many people insisted on it being about Luke. On the face of it, yes (as otherwise you'd know how the movie ends!) but after watching the film, that was my interpretation of the title. 

Balance was restored by Anakin. "
False,0,But if it's about balance then there will always be a dark side which can't be good.
False,0,Preach!!!!! I 100% agree!!!
False,0,"Balance between the light and dark side, one is nothing with out the other and they are both needed to keep the universe running   "

False,2,Part of me wishes they would of stuck with existing planets.
False,2,"Not really. Obvious similarities aside, the two planets have very different social structures and galactic roles. Besides, who wouldn't hate living in a desert? :P"
False,0,Blue but I'd want yellow with a curved hilt.
False,0,Blue is most common. I prefer orange 
False,0,I'd want orange or a dark wine color red
False,0,Black. Yellow. Purple. Turn to Dark side. Have sex. Use Red. 
False,1,I would say blue (on both accounts).
False,0,DLT-19 or A280C
False,0,DL-44 or defender sporting blaster pistol.
False,1,Haven't seen the movie yet. But captain phasmas blaster in Force Awakens looks bad ass.  
False,0,Muun are the guys who run the banking clan. Plagueis died. Sideous made sure of that.
False,0,Would be awesome if true!!
False,0,Hi
False,0,Very possible that our Munn Friend cheated death. 
False,0,Plus Tarkin book references Darth Plagious book a lot.
False,1,"Palpatine never upholds the rule of two very well. Plagious is never confirmed dead. Plus I think this should finally let Disney take on ownership of 1-3. Disney avoids them like black ""plagious"" lol jk but not"
False,0,It's jar jar
False,0,Mesa not a Sith Lord!
False,0," Brucewhelan, It's been confirmed the Jar Jar is not in the movie."
False,0,S/o to T1D2 bc I was thinking the same thing. A lot of sith have been able to over come death but only darth plaguous could for life. But that would be a good ass eye opener for the fans!!!
False,0,In the trailer I swear I saw boba feet
False,0,They hinted a few times in aftermath. Dengar says that he sees him and they find a set of Mandalorian armor in one of the Tatooine scenes. I am guessing he lived and ditched the armor since he is easily recognized with it on. An armor-less Boba could walk through Jabba's palace and not be noticed. Easy to pick out that Beskar in a crowd.
False,1,"We don't know yet. In Aftermath it's hinted that Boba got out, and the trailer for Battlefront hinted at that as well, but we'll just have to wait and see."
False,0,"Chaissus has a point. Though only Dark Side users are more commonly known for force chocking, Vader the most famous. There isn't really anything about it that defies it as Dark or Light side, only what is in the users heart. 

Force lightning is definitely a sith thing though, I recall it was named Sith Lightning at some stage"
False,0,Never knew force choke was only limited to the dark side.
False,0,Very true!  Even though Luke Is a powerful force user and is for the good of things.  If he dabbled in the dark side of the force too much it's extremely possible it consumed him.  Anakin for example.  
False,1,"While I doubt the rumors about Luke going dark, that moment in ROTJ has always made me wonder."
False,0,No that was a theory but no.
False,0,I agree
False,0,"True, but the episodes in S2 still feel too short. While if they were more 2 part episodes, the stories could be bigger"
False,1,"I don't see the point really. The Clone Wars was an anthology-based series, so story arcs were mandatory, but Rebels is one giant continuation. Each episode builds off of the previous one."
False,0,It does sound like a video game and the force unleashed three was hinted at
False,0,Though 2 definitely was good. It did deliver short. And that whole dark side bonus thing at the end was just weird and that was the moment that really ruined it for me
False,0,"It is, but I loved the first one, and was absolutely heartbroken at how disappointing two was. "
False,0,It's a shame when a story is left untold
False,0,"Well now that u mention it, actually yeah"
False,0,I'm sure the story would allow a 3rd...but I don't thing the 2nd did well enough. 
False,0,"I agree that TFU2 lacked atmosphere, but it ended with Vader being captured like they had a 3rd one planned"
False,0,"Probably not, I thought 2 kind of sucked...."
False,1,yeah it really does 
False,0,"Sorry, I don't think it's possible."
False,1,saber staff definitely

False,2,One that works
False,0,Han Solo
False,1,Darth maul/Shaak Ti. 
False,2,Yoda
False,2,No I was taking about on the show. 
False,1,"Also, if you saw her in the live action movies on Geanosis, that was Shaak Ti, not Ahsoka"
False,3,"The Clone Wars TV series fills the gap between Episodes II and III. The reason she was on Geonosis is because a second battle was fought there following the events of Episode II, after Anakin received her as his Padawan. More info can be found at http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano."
False,0,"Dooku would win, maul doesn't even have force lightning rofl 😈"
False,1,Long fight. But doku would win at the end
False,1,Mauls overconfidence is his weekness. That's why Ob1 defeated him. Dooku could take him easily 
False,1,Dooku's age would also be a weakness in a duel. Maul would cut through that slow old man.
False,2,Count dooku is smarter and a master swordsman
False,1,Darth Maul. I belive he is more skilled in swordplay than Dooku
False,0,That would be one to watch !
False,1,I think it would be darth maul because I do not know Kylo rens information
False,1,It was originally gonna be in season 7 of The clone wars. The story reels on. YouTube 
False,1,*April 2014
False,1,Yes. Everything released after April 2015 that's not part of something legends is canon.
False,1,"^Blood Lines is Legends. This post is referring to the new canon short story ""The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku,"" which is a tie-in to Episode VII."
False,0,"Read the book""blood lines"" about Boba fett."
False,0,How the hell are they still alive?
False,0,"He has his own spin off film in a few years time, might appear at the end in slave 1 like a marvel credit scene, so it's possible "
False,0,I doubt it; it wouldn't be relevant to the plot and would just bog down the story. Perhaps he'll show up in Rogue One or the Han Solo film.
False,0,I wish but I don't think so since he would be pretty old and I personally would want my boba fett experience to end while he's still young and cool
False,0,That would be cool!!
False,0,I hope so
False,0,Only a few good legends exist and even fewer are true.
False,0,I love legends 
False,0,I hate Canon. it is a monstrosity.
False,1,It will change because the Canon stories are just starting out while there was some 40 odd years of legends.
False,0,"I think with legends, not everyone reads them and all that so you can't just have a movie on it without the audience being aware of what's happening/happened.."
False,0,"Looks good but seems kinda watered down compared to legends. But perhaps that will change with time...

False,0,"Fives. 
Tup.

False,0,Hello
False,0,Lol
False,0,Wat U says?
False,0,Hey 
False,0,"I think that Rey and Finn will be equal Jedi and kylo will be the apprentice to an even stronger Sith master, that way we will be able to see multiple Sith and not just 1"
False,0,When Rey announces herself as a jedi. I'm willing to bet that she will have a double lightsaber. So the staff she is carrying is simply training her how to weild a double lightsaber
False,0,"I do believe that Rey is the main Jedi, but Kylo will last long because of his power. He is resistant to the light side of the force"
False,0,Agreed. I kinda feel that Kylo might just be a fanatical guy obsessed with Vader bc snow was interested in Vader. I think a lot of back story on smoke will be revealed and Kylo with be one of those villains that is dangerous bc he is sociopathic and has the resources.
False,0,I think Kylo will grow in strength until he becomes a force to reckoned with. Rey Wii grow stronger also.
False,0,I'm a fan fiction writer. But Star wars is something I dare not touch because of the highest respect that I have for the ever growing franchise
False,0,Since Kylo has Vaders helmet what else could he have salvaged. Luke has Vaders lightsaber or Snoke could have it 
False,0,"@MadisHook Execpt that we've already seen Kylo unmasked and he's definitly not Luke.
----------
I think Kylo robbed Anakin's tomb."
False,0,Interesting.. Very interesting 
False,0,Maybe that will be revealed Dec.18
False,0,I've thought of that too. This only adds fuel to the Kylo Ren=Luke debate. 
False,2,It's Ian McDiarmid. he played him in episodes 1 and 2. 
False,0,I don't know his name. It's the same guy though. He had to use more makeup for Revenge of the Sith since he was older then.
False,0,I just watched that movie today!
False,0,"He is being played by Gollem actor, and the face of King Kong"
False,0,There is no Canon image of him.
False,1,Galen
False,1,"Its Dooku, but I would have to go with Galen."
False,1,Galen
False,1,"Galen , he has force fury."
False,0,Thanks!
False,0,"Ben Kenobi acknowledged R2 like their could have been history. But R2 didn't acknowledge back. That could either be because of a memory wipe, or the fact that Obi Wan had aged a lot.
Plus, R4 was Obi Wans droid, R2 was Anakins, maybe he spent little time with Obi wan during the prequels and clone wars. 

Maybe R2 did recognize Yoda, but without 3PO to translate, we never know what he said. 

And I don't recall the droids ever facing Vader. Face to face. So maybe Vader didn't know that they were the same droids, while the droids wouldn't have recognized Anakin"
False,0,They had a memory wipe. 
False,0,One idea is that he purged his memories of the Jedi (at least the visual data) thinking he wouldn't see them again and was unnecessary. Or maybe he does remember and we just don't see it.
False,0,R2 has been through far worse then getting shot by a TIE Fighter without any apparent memory loss.
False,1,"Yeah and when Ben kenobi found R2 on tattooine he didn't seem to recognise them, neither did Vader (Anakin)"
False,0,"Maybe when R2 was being fixed after the Battle of Yavin he lost some of his memory. I mean yes he has been shot a few times before, but not by a laser blast from a ship. It could have some more damage to his system"
False,4,Only C-3P0 got his memory erased. Any other in-universe suggestions?
False,1,Also at the end of the prequels r2 and cp0 got there data erased
False,2,Senator Organa wipes R2-D2 and C-3PO's memories at the end of ep.III Revenge of the Sith.
False,0,"Yoda: Much to learn,you still have "
False,0,"The force is the force, how you interpret it or whatever faction you choose won't alter what the force is. "
False,0,"Sith is just a name. There is no dark or light side. There is just the force. The dark side just means that you aren't afraid to explore for the sake of gaining power. As long as you are strong in the force, it doesn't matter. "
False,0,Not a Sith =/= Not powerful.
False,0,They thought the same thing about Vader. Luke still sensed good in him. Darkness cannot overcome the light 
False,0,Kylo is proved powerful because he can use the force and is immune to the light side of the force
False,0,"True, but the force could only help
"
False,0,General grievous wasn't a Sith and if you have seen Star Wars the clone wars tv serious and the third movie you will know that you don't have to be a Sith to be very powerful 
False,0,I wonder if he can use force lightning or does he also have a prosthetic arm or hand. That's what limited Vader to using a choke only.
False,0,And he still has the force I'm guessing 
False,0,"If Disney brings out another star wars show, it will probably be a serious one rather than a preschool aimed show. As far as I'm aware, if characters die in a cartoon, it can be for grown ups and that makes it a serious show. 
For the record, the LEGO ones are a joke in my opinion and have no canon legitimacy. 

I don't think another show by Filoni's team will come out while Rebels lives. Though another team may pop up and bring a new star wars show with a brand new design"
False,2,"Those shows were created by George Lucas. With the Disney acquisition, Lucas is only a consultant, so more shows like that are very unlikely. Disney = larger budget + greater resources - Lucas."
False,0,"If they did, the only way they could do it is no jar jar, unless he does in the first episode... sorry jar jar fans"
False,0,"Excuse my typos, guys!"
False,1,"Well, what the people above say, but in my opinion, Canon is a few movies and Legends is a Galaxy. Canon simply cannot compare."
False,0,"Ayrehead92 & Brandon Rhea: maybe I should rephrase. Legends can possibly be carried over as canon when confirmed, like when Sidious tells the Legend of Darth Plagueis. I should have said that aspects can be speculation"
False,0,Well as you can see this isn't such a noob question after all someone will aways know more than you so in a way where all noobs lol.
False,1,"AceLM92: ""it makes Revan and the KotOR still canon as well""

It's actually the opposite of that. Until something is specifically mentioned as being canon, it should be considered Legends. That's why novels and games are being re-released with a new ""Legends"" banner - everything (not from the films or the Clone Wars) pre-April 25, 2014 is Legends unless otherwise stated."
False,0,OK that's kinder cool I love the PT the way it is but I get where your coming from want anakin to show his true power and skill but how will order 66 coming to play
False,0,Sorry for typos.. Autocorrect isn't my friend.
False,0,"Honestly I wish they would just redo the prequels and change up the storey a little bit. The way Anakin turned to the dark side it's stupid and probably was the most disappointing part of them to me. I think the first movie should be wiped, star with Anakin being a bad ass Jedi who is reckless but efficient, much like the clone wars show.  The second movie he turns to the dark side by the end: not because of love because that's ridiculously stupid, but because he sees that he can become more powerful faster, which he wants to do because padme gets murdered (by the emperor but he frames the Jedi council.) and he wants revenge.  The third movie he it's Darth Vader and just goes on a Jedi killing spree. Boom. Not that hard and way more satisfying for fans. You're welcome."
False,0,OK thanks for clearing that out so what about the PT.
False,1,"DarthGirlPower: All of the new comics and books released since April 2014 are canon as well. 

Markus Pryde: No all of the Original Trilogy is canon including Episode V.

AceLM92: While the character Darth Bane is canon, the Darth Bane novels and the events they depict, as well as KOTOR and its events are entirely legends not canon. "
False,0,Man this whole thing is mixed up.
False,0,The force
False,0,Thanks
False,0,"Even though Luke and Leia didn't know it, they shared a Force bond since they're both twins and Skywalkers. Leia was as naturally strong in the Force, so Luke knew to call for Leia through the Force, though he didn't understand why for another year. And Leia sensed him though she didn't understand how."
False,1,I agree. Force telepathy is strong in those who posses an affinity to the Force
False,0,I think he was just calling for anyone and she just happened to sense him needing help
False,0,"And did he call her with the force, twin telepathy, or a mix of both?"
False,0,That's just cheesy 70s and 80s acting
False,0,Thanks
False,0,They may have sensors or some type of component that can feel or detect pain. Kind of like a peripheral nervous system found in sentient life-forms.

False,0,The Star Forge isn't a building. I don't think it's known where the largest buildings are (besides Coruscant). 
False,0,As well as I am informed the starforge is the biggest structure in the galaxy. If you want to look it up: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Forge
False,0,Well it is a mandalorian custom to pass armor from father to son etc
False,0,I believe boba took the helmet and made it his own
False,0,"It would be great to see bona come back in the new movies.
"
False,1,"The original helmet is probably gone, but it is Mandalorian tradition to take shards of ancestors' armor and imbed it into the ones own armor so perhaps Boba retained some pieces. "
False,0,"But the confusing thing is, when Boba used it in in the Clone Wars show, he put a bomb in it and when a someone touched it, it got obliterated."
False,0,"I believe the second is true. All I know is boba buried his father and kept the helmet and armor so
Im sure it's the same one "
False,0,"In terms of large, the Executor-class is the larger. Talking about mass and size, the Eclipse-class wins. "

False,0,"If it was released before April 2015, it's not canon. (Except for the films and the Clone Wars TV series)"
False,0,Nooooooo
False,1,"Nope. The Republic/Imperial Commando books are all Legends, although some of the characters have shown up in The Clone Wars TV show and are canon."
False,0,Though the wookipedia page regarding the battle of hoth puts it at 30 month after the battle of yavin and 6 months before that battle of endor... Definitely not much time for training
False,0,"I believe the accepted timeline is that there's 3 years between New Hope and Empire, and 1 year between Empire and Jedi"
False,0,"""Return of the jedi"" is not 3 years after ""Empire""? I think so, it took a lot of time to find where han solo was... I think that "" empire"" was 1 year after ""a new hope"" (sorry if there is any grammar mistake, english is not my first language)"
False,0,"He claims that he's a Jedi Knight, not a Master. He completed his training in the year between Empire and Return of the Jedi, becoming a knight with the construction of his lightsaber. "
False,0,"There's a deleted scene showing luke building his lightsaber in a cave on tattooine, so I would assume that he underwent his own physical training there as well as perhaps communing with obi-wan's ghost to learn more about the force in general"
False,0,"There's nearly a year set between Episodes V and VI, so it's likely that Luke learned more during that time."
False,2,A testimony to Star Wars original plots and character development 
False,2,"I loved this episode. I figured Ezra's parents had died, but I assumed that was prior to the events of season one. The reveal that they died after Ezra's broadcast was genuinely surprising (and heartbreaking)."
False,0,There were even rumors that said she originally died by Grievous hands and the one appearing in The force unleashed was Ahsoka but that wouldn't make any sense with Ahsoka in Rebels. Master Shaak's current status is unknown.  
False,0,"Wasn't she supposed to survive the assault on the Jedi temple and then go into hiding, but then get killed by marek years later?"
False,0,She also died in The Force Unleashed.
False,0,There are 2 delete scenes 
False,0,I dunno but for whatever reason I saw both IN ONE MOVIE 
False,0,"Both are deleted scenes. Originally she was planned to die aboard the Invisible Hand. Then that was changed to be in the Jedi Temple. Both scenes were ultimately cut, so here final fate is unknown."
False,1,"General Grivous and Anakin both kill her. 
Apparently, you only die twice."
False,1,"I've seen the deleted scene, I'm not sure about the other one?"
False,1,There is also this crazy thread theory about Snoke being Jar Jar Binks
False,0,Snoke is the supreme leader of the first order . It's also been theorized he is Darth Plagueis.
False,0,"In the clone wars someone says malachor like how one would say a swear word in real life. I think since the destruction of malachor 5 may be cannon Revan may also be, "
False,0,"Please no, Revan doesn't deserve to be ruined by Rebels. Especially that kid.
Reznov: Kanaan... Ezra... Chooper - these ""men"" must die!"
False,0,"It would be cool if Ezra starts seeing ghosts of Sith Lords on Rebels and then we can see Revan, Nihilus and more"
False,1,I really only care about legends at this point 
False,0,"Also, Revan was scheduled to make a Force ghost cameo in The Clone Wars, but the appearance was cut. I wouldn't be surprised if he were retconned back into canon at some point or another."
False,2,"The fact that Revan was part of Darth Bane's rise to power in Legends doesn't have any impact on Darth Bane in canon. Darth Bane was canonized by the appearance of his spirit in ""Sacrifice,"" the final completed episode of The Clone Wars."
False,1,New canon is bullshit. Legends is true Star Wars canon to the true fans 
False,1,The Bane that appeared in Clone wars was nothing like the Bane the of novels. I think the Sithari we all know and love isn't canon. Instead a ghost with the same name is.
False,1,"Right now, Raven isn't in the Canon, only because he hasn't been mentioned. It is possible he may come out in one of the Anthology films or future canon novels"
False,1,"The pre-trilogy also references the rule of two does it not? If so, it would lend credibility to the idea that Bane would NEED to be considered canon based on that alone.. Right?? "
False,1,"I would put my left arm in the line: there is no way that Luke is Kylo Ren!

I think we have a treat in wait on Wednesday. When Luke enters the screen he is going to have a badass entrance."
False,0,No 
False,0,It is SURE that he is not Luke. Like I said there are photos about kylo with no mask.
False,0,Haha same here
False,0,I hope he's not 
False,0,Yeah but there's so many posts supporting the argument of him being Kylo. Kinda saddening but I'm pretty sure nobody would like such a plot twist 
False,1,No. There are photos about Kylo without mask when they are doing the film so you can see that he is not Luke ^^
False,0,"I think Yoda regardless of age. 

I'm not particularly knowledgeable on the different forms of fighting but I think Anakin's arrogance cost him the fight against Obi-Wan. The only reason Obi-Wan lasted as long as he did (I believe) is that he trained Anakin so would know how to counter his moves. 

Obi-Wan tells Anakin that he could be as good a swordsman as Yoda (suggests that he see Yoda as better with a lightsaber).

He beat Grievance by shooting him rather than lightsaber battle although he held his own. "
False,1, since kenobi was able to defeat general grevious a infamous Jedi killer and pre darth Vader anakin skywalker one of the most powerful people in the Jedi council I believe that he would be able to defend against yodas attacks and counter with his own offensive stradegy 
False,1,I could see him learning to be wiser and more knowledgeable in the force but I wouldn't think he'd get stronger/more powerful in the last 20 years of his life. 
False,2,"Very True^ however, we haven't seen Yoda in combat since ROTS so perhaps hiding in Dagobah, a planet strong in the Force, has strengthened him. "
False,1,"Both of them in their prime? Yoda, no question.  However... Even in Revenge of the Sith Yoda is clearly showing his age against Darth Sideous, who btw describes Anakin as ""more powerful than both of us"" to Yoda, and Obi-Wan beats Anakin. I think before and even during the Clone Wars Yoda is definitely the favorite. However I believe his battle with the emperor weakened him to where it'd be a pretty even fight between Yoda and Obi-Wan"
False,1,Yoda I fact I was trying to think of a way Obi wan would win but can't.
False,1,Yoda would slice and dice him.
False,1,"Even though I love obi-wan, yoda would win"

False,0,"I guess you could say he's a ""fan"" of the Sith."
False,0,"He's a Dark Jedi inspired by the Sith (Vader specifically), but not exactly a Sith himself in the traditional sense. At lease that's what I've read."
False,0,More of a pretender in my eyes
False,0,"It's pretty clear that he's a dark side user, but my guess on why they said he's not a Sith is because his training isn't complete yet. "
False,0,But heck if I kno. 😜
False,0,I think he's frum the knights of ren which I think are a bunch of dark-sidey-ish  guys. 
False,1,Maybe hes Force confused?
False,1,"It's been explicitly stated that he isn't a Sith, but there's nothing to suggest he's a Jedi either. He instead seems to be part of a faction separate from both called the Knights of Ren, although he might be the only force-sensitive member. "
False,0,"I am willing to give the new Canon a chance. The legends timeline had some good stuff to be sure. But not all of it was good and it sometimes tended to contradict itself or rehash the same things. I'm hoping that the new Canon can change things up a bit. Maybe show that the ""light side"" isn't always ""good"" and the ""dark side"" isn't always ""evil"""
False,2,"I'm sure we will. Just looking at The Force Awakens, 
I'm willing to bet characters like Kylo and Phasma will be just as iconic/popular among fans.

And to the above post, true Star Wars fans should be critical of the franchise, but give credit where due. With that said, the new canon's got my support."

False,1,Would be awesome.
False,1,I think it would be cool. We would get many new sith and jedi that weren't so known before
False,1,The rumored Netflix original star wars series could be around the old Republic era. Either that or the anthology films. They have to acknowledge the era further with Darth Bane in the Canon
False,3,I agree there mini shorts are amazing
False,0,"I'm sure there are connections, but I don't like thinking about it (I want to be 100% surprised when I see the movie). Less than 10 days away!"
False,0,Boba Fett should appear in Han's stands alone film in my opinion. They have a history of being frienemies. 
False,0,How will Han get a movie tho? I'm like so confused! Would H. ford play him still? Because he's getting old and I kinda would rather see a prequel which won't happen.
False,0,"I agree, I was just wondering whether the bounty hunter movie will be set during the empire or after these new movies"

False,0,"Star Wars 1313 is a canceled Star Wars game featuring Boba Fett. The trailer can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yyoqNgOi_g
It was canceled when Disney took over. And yes, to answer the question, I am quite upset."
False,0,Sorry I do not know what 1313 is. Could you explain it to me?
False,0,Clones can use he force!?! Wtf? That can't be right 
False,0,"I dunno maybe 
"
False,0,"Clone troopers are not stormtroopers. Fynn isn't a clone, he's just force sensitive"
False,0,^ This 
False,2,"X1 and X2 were Clone Troopers, though not cloned from Jango Fett, but rather the Jedi Falon Grey. X1 went on to make one of the many splinter factions of the Empire after the Battle of Endor, and became a Sith Lord. X2 had, however, joined the Rebellion and became a Jedi, one of the many trained by Luke Skywalker directly. He later killed his brother on Mustafar when he attempted to make a clone army of Skywalker.

These are now, however Legends. The game's plot was quite nice, really, even if the gameplay was terrible. Once again I find myself blaming Disney for this."
False,0,I think it would be a pretty good idea.
False,0,Well we have a storm trooper becoming a Jedi in the force awakens. So maybe
False,0,I don't think that concept will come into play in the New canon
False,0,Uh. No. 
False,0,"Well, it was already a video game. It was okay. "
False,0,Leia was definitely a trained Jedi Knight in the EU. 
False,0,I don't no I don't really pay attention to EU plz don't hate
False,0,"She does not train in the ways of the jedi, but is still force sensitive. In TFA she is a general and no longer the princess of a planet that exploded a long time ago. "
False,0,In the EU she becomes almost as powerful as Luke.
False,0,I hope so.
False,0,"Technically, the EU was canon. Go read Wookieepedia if you don't know that :-)
But who the hell cares about canon and non-canon, canon is what you like!"
False,0,"The Solo kids, I assume you're speaking of Jacen/DarthCadeius & Jaina? Yeah that's been pushed aside to 'Legends' (non-canon), And, even though the film makers, producers, etc. do their very best to keep everything strictly confidential, except obviously what we see from the trailers/teasers, & toys, in those which they've allowed us to see, there's nothing in them at all whatsoever pertaining to the original Solo family or any legends stuff. Basically after the sale, of Lucasfilm Ltd. from George to Disney, first they pushed whatever they wanted over to (Ledends) , & hired writers, & screen-writers to pen entirely new scripts, to continue from after Return of Jedi, moving forward. And also all of the stuff that is now ""filling in the blanks"" so to speak...for ex. the time periods after the events of Epusode III, in bet that & ep IV, etc. and then actually, I just realized myself while typing this, the fact that Clone wars series is Canon, that was actually started off by Lucas, that might be the only extra Lucas material they've kept, yeah so Series:Clone Wars seasons 1-6, and lastly in regards to me speaking of ""filling in blanks"", I guess what's left is.. SW Rebels.& the newer novels and comics/graphic novels. "
False,1,"Disney has utterly ruined my Star Wars world, even if it is still up to me what to believe and what not to believe."
False,0,He made Star Wars. His right only dissipated when he sold to Disney. 
False,2,Lucas has yet to earn the right to claim Star Wars. He made a few movies. The EU made a galaxy. 
False,0,"The solo twins are a concept from the EU.  The EU is no longer canon, and technically, never was. In the eyes of Lucas, only his movies were canon, which is something few people seem to understand. I have nothing against the EU, I enjoyed the Empire comics and the Legacy comics. And still think of many of those stories as worth being official canon."
False,0,Darn. Okay thanks
False,0,From what has been released they don't. 
False,0,"Damn!! Did I see someone noted that there's approximately 400 million planets that have life?,I the SW Galaxy/galaxies??!! Sheesh! Where do I find that? Can I look on one of these apps or could I find that sort of info in the many books out in B & N for instance?"
False,0,Not exactly. Similar. You can even say Chewbaka is a kind of dog. All of the creatures made by LucesArts  comes from a animal in our world.
False,0,Probably 
False,0,http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dog/Legends
False,0,"There is quite a bit of references to dogs in the EU, so you could say that yes there are dogs in Star Wars."
False,0,"There are over 400 million inhabited planets in the galaxy, and many more that support life. Yes, I think it's safe to say, there are dogs. Not even counting the countless canoid species. "
False,2,"I believe the EU did have some straight up dogs. I don't know if NuCanon has used them yet, but like Rex said, with the fact that Marrok exists (Embo's pet) it's possible that other dog like mammals exist, including things very similar to dogs, if not outright dogs. "
False,0,"Embo has a pet dog wolf thing. Plus there is the Wolf Pack, so I'd imagine there are some wolves and dogs in the universe.... somewhere"
False,0,"Several kinds of dog-like creatures. Massifs, Kath Hounds, Anoobas, Akk Dogs...the list probably goes on."
False,1,"Here you go:

False,0,I cried 😢
False,1,"A sad episode to be sure, but I'm hoping this will drive Ezra back towards the light, as he definitely displayed some dark side tendencies prior to and during the Empire's assault on Garel City. A good ending to the first act of Rebels' second season."
False,0,HAHAHA. I could list things all day and you still wouldn't have a complete timeline. 
False,0,"The movies? In terms of when each event happened, it goes in the episodic order. So: Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. The Force Awakens happens 30 years after ROTJ."
False,0,Copy cat 🐱.... Just kidding👍🏻
False,0,"^I like that explanation for my personal canon-records lol. Losing so much good canon because of Disney. Hopefully this is an opportunity to create some even BETTER, more consistent canon for this wonderful universe. "
False,1,"Not entirely true. In addition to the Jango clones, the Empire commissioned clone batches from countless other templates, both from Kamino and other sources. By the Battle of Yavin, one third of the Stormtrooper Corps was a clone of some sort. "
False,0,"The Stormtroopers were not clones. In the very early days of the Empire, the clone troopers served as the first generation of Imperial Stormtroopers, but were eventually phased out. By the time of A New Hope, the Stormtrooper Corps are made up of human enlists, not clones of Jango Fett.

Also, it's the First Order, not the New Order. :~)"
False,3,"In response to your question, the clone troopers are eventually phased out by normal human recruits who are trained at various Imperial Academies throughout the galaxy. Disney's Star Wars Rebels series and John Fry's Servants of the Empire novella series deals with that topic. After the Empire was created, the clone troopers were renamed Stormtroopers and the Jango Fett clones grew old and were replaced. Btw, the First Order is not directly descended from the Empire but is an organization that admired the Empire. Think of them as neo-Nazis."
False,1,"I feel that Finn could be killed off near to the end of the film or at the start of EP VIII, just to give the whole new trilogy a new spin on things, at the moment TFA just seems to be like a reimagined and more up to date version of a new hope...."
False,1,"An AWOL Stormtrooper with fencing lessons under his belt isn't a terrible premise. It's like trying to be a Jedi without the use of the Force, putting you at a disadvantage forcing you to be smarter than your foe in several ways. Alternatively, Boyega might be a decoy protagonist who gets killed in the end. Liam Neeson took up a sizable chunk of the TPM poster, after all. Of course you can argue his legacy had a big affect on the remaining prequels, but with that said, he was still killed off before the prequel story even began. "
False,0,All that we know is that Mark Hamill will be acting as Luke Skywalker in the film. Have to wait and see what happens to John Boyega and Daisy Ridley.
False,0,No.  It would be an interesting twist tho
False,0,"Because of what Luke stood for. I believe it is more likely that Kylo Ren is a clone of Anakin, than Luke turned evil. I mean just look at the shot in the trailer with Kylos hair?  Looks a little like III Anakin. "
False,1,"In my opinion, Kylo has no affiliation with Luke. I think that Luke will be acting sort of how Obi-wan did in A New Hope. I think a major plot point in TFA will be Han Solo helping the two new characters find Luke to be trained in the ways of the force. More evidence that Luke is NOT Kylo is because of how his lightsaber looks. From what we've seen, the beam of the lightsaber isn't very solid and it appears to be made by someone who hasn't had any training in making a lightsaber. This piece of evidence is a little less solid but I think it's valid for speculation.
"
False,0,"Kylo is not Luke as they are different actors ;) but yes, it would have been sweet. Mark Hamill is Luke while Adam Driver is Kylo"
False,0,I hope that Kylo is Luke.
False,0,Yes I think Kylo is his apprentice personally 
False,0,"How old would Yoda have been when he was a padawan? He says he is 800 years old in ep.V.

If Wookies live to be 400 years then Yoda would of been 300 something years old if Wookies remembered him as a padawan.

Ironic since Yoda claimed Luke was too old to train right?

"
False,0,Bowdaar was also few centuries old in SWTOR
False,0,The EU is no longer canon
False,0,"The problem with Chewbacca appearing it episode 7 is that in the EU he has died several years BEFORE hand. If this is Chewbacca from episode 4,5,6 and 3 (yes he makes a appearance in Episode 3 ) then that would mean this film does NOT tie in with Star Wars EU. I personally don't think that works with the Star Wars storyline."
False,0,"You could just check the Wookie article. Note the name WOOKIEpediea. But several hundred years is about right. Chewy was about 200 in the OT. Before the fall of Kashyyyk, there were some living Wookies that remembered as far back as when Yoda was a Padawan. "
False,0,This is the wiki look it up 
False,1,400 years
False,0,They typically live for centuries.
False,0,"Real reason for the green color is lighting/filming issues. They had a hard time capturing that piercing blue color against the sky when Jabba is sentencing Luke, Han, and Chewie. Canon-wise, it's what everyone said above. "
False,1,Star Wars Episode 6 Return Of The Jedi.
False,1,"In Legends, Luke constructs his lightsaber in Shadows of the Empire, a multimedia series that bridges ESB and ROTJ. In Canon, we don't yet know the story. However, in Heir to the Jedi, a canon novel released early this year, Luke is given a lightsaber and disassembles it to see its workings; also, in a recent issue of the Star Wars comic, Luke and co. discover a loot of lightsabers. These points may be expanded upon in the future."
False,1,There was a deleted scene for ROTJ that shows how Luke got his green light saber
False,1,Why is Luke's saber green?
False,2,The reason why lukes lightsabor was green because it was a gift from yoda. But obviously its not yodas because in revenge of the sith when yoda duelled with chancellor palpatine his lightsaber was like half his size lol
False,1,Thanks very much ;)
False,1,"Cwendin, at what point did Luke assemble his lightsaber? Or was it a gift from Yoda?"
False,2,"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi
Fun Fact: Luke's green lightsaber was intended to be blue, but the color was changed during production."
False,1,Return of the jedi. Luke Skywalker uses a green lightsaber.
False,0,Clones
False,1,"It's not really as simple as that. While clone troopers and first-generation Stormtroopers all came from the same genetic stock, later generations of Stormtroopers were recruited humans from across the galaxy who trained in a variety of Imperial Academies, allowing for too many variables to really make a fare judgement. However, it is fairly obvious that not all Stormtroopers are created equal, so I personally believe that the Fett clones are overall the superior soldier."
False,1,Phase two clone also it depends on the storm trooper some are more skilled than other and same with the phase two clone
False,1,Certainly a phase 2 clone trooper. Rex comes back in Rebels Season Two and trounces several Stormtroopers in the recent episode Stealth Strike.
False,1,"I wasn't sure how new content was going to be handled, and frankly I haven't looked. But this is good to hear, Brandon. You guys are doing pretty damn good. "

False,0,I wonder the interaction between the 2 were deleted in the movie. I remember watching it in the theater and hearing how disappointed they were when the scene was never shown.
False,0,"Because he had no connection to Luke, whereas, both Ben Kenobi and Yoda both knew Luke before their deaths."
False,0,Maybe Kylo Ren hold the sacred position of The Mandalore? Hence the reason for their militant-like behavior? 
False,0,Doesn't Finn have Anakin's Lightsaber now?
False,0,Daaahlen is wrong on kylo fighting for the lightsaber because in episode 5 Luke drops anakin's/vader's lightsaber during his battle against Vader. Luke makes his own lightsaber. 
False,0,"It is said that he wears an ancient Mandalore helmet. This has no fact in it, and the idea comes from Darth Raven and how it looks like it. But Darth Raven not being canon, it's not Mandalore"
False,0,Or he is luke!!!
False,0,"kylo ren is a human from the knights of ren and is obsessed with collectibg darth vader artifacts (thus darth vaders burnt helmet in the trailer) which leads me to believe he might face off luke for his lightsaber (because it was originally anakin/vaders), although some people think luke has turned to the dark side, so ren might have turned luke to the dark side whilst trying to get his lightsaber"
False,0,"There is part of an article about that on this wiki. I believe it's under either ""Darth Vader"" or ""Sebastian Shaw"""
False,0,I thought to show him as anakin before he went to the dark side and became Darth
False,0,"""After he returned to the light?"" He returned to the light when he betrayed Palpatine and saved Luke. I think his Force Ghost should have absolutely been at his age as of RotJ, his redeemed form dying in Luke's arms."
False,0,"Because they show Anakin as a Jedi not as Vader, After he returned to the light and to Luke's father Anakin. It just to show his father as good. "
False,1,"It's to fit in with the continuity established in the first three films. To have Anakin look more like we saw him in the first three is great, but I much prefer the original cut myself. The unmasking scene also doesn't match when young Anakin is put into the 'ghost' shots. You might as well add Ewan MacGregor rather than Alec Guinness in that case.  "
False,0,The worst Star Wars book ever. 'Nuff said.

False,0,I thought it was written so badly that I couldn't finish it. Lost Stars was far better
False,1,^Twilight Company was fantastic.
False,0,"Not bad, not great. . . Agree on the characters not being likable (with the exception of the droid and the drathomirian chick) , in general it's way to ""PC"" for my preference.  Although I may like it more after the movie and other books come out.

I thought Battleftont was far better "
False,0,"I was a bit disappointed by it. I didn't care much for the characters, plot, or writing style. Nonetheless, I loved Rae Sloane, the PTSD moments, and the interlude segments. Hopefully the next two novels improve my feelings for it."

There is little to no possible way that a 20something with minimal training, and next no lightsaber training, could take down one of the most power Siths ever who's defeated and mauled through who knows how many Jedi,  by only  yelling and taking long horizontal swings at him 

Therefore, we are left thinking:

-if Vader threw the dual as he was already coming back
-if the suit was failing already
-if Palpatine was influencing it

Etc etc "
False,0,"I don't think so. When Vader starts talking about Leia, he was clearly trying to upset Luke. And if he was holding back at all, it was probably to lure Luke to the dark side."

False,0,"The Darth Jar Jar theory is a great theory full of interesting ideas and possibilities. But it is just a theory, nothing more than that"
False,2,Whatchutalkinbout? Robot Chicken should be canon. 
False,0,"^Totally agree. Fun Fact: in a recent book series re-imagining the prequels to be Shakespearean, Jar Jar is in fact a mastermind pretending to be a fool. Also, Robot Chicken did the ""Jar Jar is a Sith"" thing long ago. Either way, both are strictly non-canon (hallelujah)."
False,1,"No, for a few reasons. First, it is canon that Jar Jar spent all but his childhood in Gunga city. There, it would have been impossible for him to learn the ways of the Force, much less be a Sith Lord and orchestrate the fall of the Republic with Sidious as a puppet. 
Second, regarding the theory's claim that Jar Jar's acrobatics can only be done by Force-Sensitives: Jar Jar is one of the most uncoordinated, clumsy Gungans out there. Rather than believe that he's a secret Sith because he can do some acrobatics, it's much more reasonable to think ""Gungans must have a natural agility in order to survive underwater"". 
Last, even IF George made Jar Jar the evil Sith Lord behind everything in a fit of his known weirdness, his ideas for the story of the new movies were largely scrapped. With J.J. Abrams being an outspoken critic of Jar Jar, it's very unlikely that we'll ever see him again."

False,0,Vader cause he very strong in the force as well as physical strong while maul is very Much more physical

False,0,"I was never a huge fan of the heavily and untastefully drawn out post-RotJ EU although the rest of the EU I LOVE, especially the old republic era. If they made a movie based on kotor or the great hyperspace war I would totally freak lol"
False,0,"Unfortunately, I am one of the people who can't believe in both."
False,1,"As Lucasfilm themselves have stated, ""Legends"" sometimes hold some truth. And indeed, some good things from ""Legends"" are re-entering Canon, mostly via Star Wars Rebels and its tie-in media (novels, comics, etc.).

So yes, considering Legends as quasi-Canon is indeed not wrong, and a good source for speculating into New Canon. In fact, it's a very fun game to guess which Legends elements will get ""recanonized"" next :-)"
False,1,I think the Original Eu will eventually fade away i will still read and love it but will not argue about which is better. There is nothing wrong with going in a new direction since someone else took over the franchise. Look at what happened in the star trek universe....a new direction and it's still awesome.
False,0,"Here's something canon that clearly contradicts from the EU: the First Order, Finn, Rey, Kylo Ren, and everyone and everything else that exists and happens following Return of the Jedi."
False,0,Same here
False,0,"From what I saw of a panel with Filoni. There are 3 possible future arcs. The one with Ahsoka, the Cad bane Boba story, and the Bad Batch on Kashhyyyk. I just feel like it's been a while since the last release"

False,0,Another thing that may bring Plagueis into canon is the rumor that Snoke is Darth Plagueis in TFA

This article is a status article, meaning that it is one of our highest quality articles and is actually one of the first canon good articles thanks to community manager Brandon Rhea."
False,0,Bane did not create the rule of two Darth Revan created after establishing his version of the sith empire Darth Bane discovered his holocron
False,0,"Bane is also canon because of clone wars S6. 
Darth Raven is not canon"
False,6,^The Clone Wars TV show is canon.
False,0,Bane might not be because the episodes of the clone wars that showed him were made by Netflix/Lucas Arts. So it might be a gray area.

False,0,"They were under the old system, and they're part of Legends. But not Disney canon. Personally, I don't think video games should be included in any canon. They sacrifice story and accuracy for gameplay. "
False,0,"It doesn't matter what Disney calls canon, just play them the are really good games with intriguing  plot lines and plot twists. "
False,1,"Even though its noncanon, kotor and the old republic era in general could be called a grey area until material is brought forth to replace it. Some legends prove truer than others, and some may influence or even directly be part of future projects. Just my opinion though."

False,1,"We must learn to look to the future, no stay in the past."
False,1,"Of course we're changing canon to the default. It's the official story of Star Wars. If the Legends Chewbacca page was default, for example, then people searching for information about Chewbacca after they see Episode VII are going to see that he died, which is canonically false. It's to the benefit of the site's readers and Star Wars fans in generals to make this change, rather than stick to a Legends-default system that's for the benefit of only a few hardcore Legends fans."
False,1,"Wait, they're changing canon to the default?!? TRAITORS"
False,0,Yes.
False,0,"But, lets just say, I am related to one of these  friends. What do I do?"

False,0,The EU claims that it is the Force itself that gave birth to him.
False,0,Darth Plagueis reached out into the galaxy with the dark side and chose Shmi Skywalker to carry his creation of life through mitichlorian manipulation. 
False,1,"Whether Darth Plagueis did that experiment in canon remains to be seen, since the ""Darth Plagueis"" novel is Legends. However, the rest of what was said was accurate - as Qui-Gon theorized, Anakin was conceived by the will of the Force to be the Chosen One."
False,0,Darth Plaguies did an experiment on midichlorians and tried to control them. So the midichlorians conceive Anakin to bring balance to the force.
False,1,He was conceived of mediclorens or however it's spelled
False,0,He doesnt have a father
False,1,"I wish Disney hadn't destroyed the EU. Considering it sounds like they're having Solo-Skywalker children anyway, how hard would it have been to keep the continuity. It might not have been perfect, but Star Wars has been contradicting itself forever. Why stop now?"
False,1,"It doesn't matter what's canon to them. What you think is canon can be, in your own mind, canon."
False,0,"Star Wars has always been a money-maker. If people think that Lucasfilm was making all of those pre-Disney stories purely out of the goodness of their hearts and had no profit motive in mind, then those people are wrong."
False,0,Rant over. 
False,1,"I miss the EU. I don't see Star Wars as something mildly entertaining to read and watch on occasion. I see it as what it is, an enormous, fully constructed universe, that you can just lose yourself in. It has so much depth and character. Every background character has a name and story. Every starship and weapon has a story. EVERY KRIFFING FOOD SOMEONE EATS HAS INFORMATION ABOUT IT. But that's all changed. Disney's extended the reach of the megacorps outside of the Star Wars galaxy into our own. And now all Star Wars is is another way for them to line their coffers. "
False,0,You and I must be pretty similar. Everything about that sounds like me. 
False,1,Explain why SWTOR and everything before it are garbage. I find them to be the best parts.
False,0,Because SWTOR and much of the Post- ROTJ universe is garbage.
False,1,"As far as the article goes, the Wiki admins are currently separating the Legends content from the Canon content in order to clean up and organize the wiki before a butt load of new info comes in when The Force Awakens releases. So some parts of articles will be out of access for another few days.
    I wouldn't be too upset about the changing of EU Canon to legends. It's an effort to clean it up so new fans aren't overwhelmed, and Lucasfilm has gone on record stating that a lot of Legends material holds truth. That means you can believe whatever you want about what happened, it just may not necessarily be canon."
False,1,"Hi there, 

Disney established their own Star Wars continuity in order to give J.J. Abrams and other producers more flexibility and room to maneuver when producing the new Sequel Trilogy and other future films. Having spent my teenage years immersing myself in the world of the Expanded Universe, I can understand your frustration and angst. There were some outstanding elements of the old EU like the Thrawn Trilogy, Darth Bane, Knights of the Old Republic, and the Lost Tribes of the Sith stories. However, there were also a lot of plot continuity contradictions. One good example would be AOTC saying that the Republic is 1,000 years old while older EU literature like the Essential Chronology says that it is 25,000 years old. That's why some EU authors had to create the Ruusan Reformation to retcon this problem. Concerning your question about not being able to load the Legends part of the Coruscant article, bots are working on Wookieepedia to rearrange the website to emphasize the canon elements first. So there will be some disruption. "
False,0,In my opinion Clone Wars is a lot less childish then Rebels and is a bit easier to connect with the characters then it is for Rebels.   
False,0,Clone wars Rebels is to drawn out and the clone wars actually told a story that you read in book and I know both of them are but clone wars was canon and clone wars was better overall
False,0,"Clone Wars is much deeper and has better writing, but I like Rebels due to all new villians such as Inquisitors and the Seventh Sister as well as a return of a much stronger Ahsoka Tano. "
False,0,The only think about rebels it is a bit to kiddish 
False,0,That R both amazing 
False,0,Loved clone wars but rebels is growing on me
False,0,Both are great. But best start with clone wars for spoiler reasons. Aka Fulcrum
False,0,Rebels in my opinion is better so far. Clone Wars is still great but Ezra is so cool and seeing a character progress and get more powerful over time is better than a character being powerful from the start and never progressing. Chopper and Zeb are also awesome. 
False,0,The animation for Rebels makes it look like some kind of toddler's TV show.
False,2,"It's amazing how so many here love Clone Wars and dislike Rebels due to rose-colored tinted glasses of Nostalgia.

Clone Wars did not get great until S3 begins, and even then there are many filler episodes. The animation was -- to put it nicely -- ""interesting"", with plasticine faces and hair made out of cardboard.

I have the complete set of TCW, and I'm following SWR closely, and I can say with great honesty and without any persuasion, that SWR is better.

The story develops better. The animation is better. It is setting down a significant amount of New Canon. It opens up new storyline possibilities so we are not limited to the ""rail shooter"" that is the Numbered Episodes.

And it's just in its second season. Not yet 1.5 seasons has been aired, and many ""old school"" Star Wars fans -- including those who *actually* watched the Original Trilogy in the theaters -- are admitting, albeit sometimes begrudgingly, that it's a good show."
False,2,"The new canon sucks, in my opinion. Hate it."
False,2,"Basically, anything official ""Star Wars"" that was put out before April 25, 2014 is now considered ""Legends,"" save the six main movies, the Clone Wars film and the Clone Wars TV series. Those exceptions and everything official released after April 25, 2014 is considered canon, again with certain exceptions, such as a few things that are intentional continuations of Legends stories and certain comic material that is explicitly non-canon like ""Angry Birds: Star Wars."" And the reason it's so hotly debated is because a lot of people were fans of the old Legends stuff like Mara Jade Skywalker and the Thrawn books, and don't like that it's all essentially non-canon now."
False,1,"Put simply, Legends refers to all Star Wars media (novels, comics, TV shows, etc.) released prior to 2014. In 2014, Disney made the decision to reboot the Legends continuity, and announced that all upcoming media (i.e. Rebels, Episode VII) would form the new Star Wars canon. It's heavily debated because many fans were committed to the Legends universe, some for decades, and they feel the reboot is unfair to their commitment."
False,1,I hate the new canon to the point were I refuse to read or watch it. Even the new movies. The old EU was the golden days.
False,2,"While I dislike things such as the Yuuzhan Vong War, I love the Legends EU; it's the reason I became involved with Star Wars in the first place. However, the new universe is an incredible chance for better stories and a more cohesive narrative (plus it's really exciting to see it grow). All-in-all, I like both."
False,1,"Right? I honestly love the EU, it has plot holes but IMO they weren't huge. Dark Forces was amazing, along with Thrawn Trilogy, etc."
False,3,"The Old EU will certainly never die in terms of existing. I for one will always treasure the Dark Forces Saga. Now if someone found a way to simply destroy everything from the EU, like through raids or something, then we'd have a problem. "

False,1,"Why consider either non-canon? The easiest way to look at the legends and canon situation is to consider them separate continuities, both of which can co-exist. The Marvel comics have loads of separate continuities, many of which are fantastic.  "
False,0,You're very narrow minded Jace Onasi.
False,1,I consider everything in the new system that was not made before April 25th 2014 to be non-canon.
False,1,"That may be the original meaning for Legends, but with so many ""non-canon within the new canon continuity"" materials being released, it will be much easier to brand non-canon things as ""Legends"".

It's also a much shorter label: 41 characters versus 7 :-)"
False,1,"P.S. - technically, ""Legends"" is a marketing term, as is ""Infinities."" Wookieepedia considers anything from ""Infinities"" non-canon, but just because something is non-canon doesn't mean it's ""Infinities."" Same for ""Legends."""
False,1,"Not quite. Legends does not equal non-canon. For example, the ""Star Wars: Epic Yarns"" are listed as non-canon, but we don't call that ""Legends."" We list them as ""non-canon within the new canon continuity."" ""Legends"" is a term for material originating before April 25, 2014, which may include old non-canon material. But those non-canon stories may still have included stuff such as Mara Jade Skywalker which was part of the old ""Legends"" continuity. But if something goofy like ""Angry Birds"" or something includes Ezra Bird-er or something, that's just ""non-canon,"" not ""Legends."""
False,1,"Why absurd? If it's determined to be not part of Canon, it gets branded as ""Legends""; it's a designation for ""Non Canon"", not a simple rebranding of old EU.

The ""Legends"" label is a very good initiative to properly separate Canon Material with non-canon media."
False,0,Yes
False,0,Depends which side they are on...
False,0,"The reason why stormtroopers can't aim is because they were normal people trained by the empire. While clone troopers were genetically breed by kaminoans. After the rise of the Empire, very few clones remained. Those that stayed in service were the 501st, Anikans army, later Vaders. That's why the only stormtroopers who ever hit their mark were the ones at the beginning of A New Hope, Darth Vaders army"

Just read the latest Star Wars comics; you can see Han and Chewie wielding lightsabers. They are not Force sensitives. Of course, that means they wield them clumsily and just as some blunt weapons. And most likely won't be able to deflect incoming blasters shots.

But in a pinch, any individual -- Force sensitive or not -- can wield a lightsaber as a replacement for a baseball bat."
False,2,"If you read the article on midi-chlorians, it says that midi-chlorians can be used to keep an individual alive way past the point where they should have died (i.e. Keeping Grievous alive while transplanting only his vital organs into a new body), but the midi-chlorians don't enhance the individual's force-sensitivity.

False,0,"It's still early days in the Disney reign, so they may take a while to get everything right. They may have got Windig on for Aftermath which was a bombshell, and made the bad decision to make his book a trilogy series in his contract. But at least they have a consistent story over all of the platforms. 

There are references throughout linking the books to the movies to the animated series to the comics and vice versa. 

Lost Stars was an amazing read. If you want to give a Canon novel a shot. Go for lost stars. You will never watch the Original trilogy the same way again"
False,0,Piece**
False,1,"Within ten years, haters of New Canon will be dwindling so much, while a new generation of Star Wars fans raised on The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels, and the Sequel Trilogy hold sway.

Do you really want to be negative to new canon material so much you risk being disconnected to the rest of the fandom? That will be your loss, you know?"
False,1,"Yay! Close minded negativity!! Come on people, I miss parts of the old EU too but let's at least try to be a bit more open minded."
False,1,I hate Disney as as a Star Wars fan 
False,0,Well I like tano and here white sabers 
False,0,"So far the Cannon stuff(granted that I've  only listened to all on audiobook) has been great.  My only issue is the ""PC"" aspect that has been introduced.  Primarily because Disney either fears backlash from the TwitterTweens, or to fit their other platforms.  But if you wanna stay true to the OT, there's not a lot of ""diversity"" in the Empire

That being said, like the EU, there's great stuff and some cheesy stuff.  However I think cannon is learning from EU mistakes like revisiting every location in the OT and exaggerated coincidences of  minor characters effects. . . Or the flat out stupid like IG88 being the cpu of the Death Star, so needless to say, it's a good thing they scrapped a lot of ur  "
False,2,"I've personally enjoyed most of the new canon works, and especially enjoy seeing stuff from the EU being brought into the new canon. I imagine the OT focus is mostly due to the build up for TFA, as the OT characters are going to be the ones appearing in the new film. Once we get to the anthology films and beyond I imagine we'll see whole range of eras explored by the new canon. "
False,1,"That said, I loved Tarkin(Really felt movie material) and The Weapon of a Jedi.

Shattered Empire was almost there but not quite. It felt obfuscated, disjointed and too short. Too much focus on action. It doesn't explain at all however how Luke even knew about what they were going after in Issue 4. It doesn't make much sense."
False,1,"I find myself surprised at the Disney canon I have read so far.

I do miss a ton of stuff from the old EU though. They treated it like it was insignificant and didn't matter. But had no problem raiding it's coffers for tons of things instead of coming up with new things in their place.

Which is a double edge sword.

What I really dislike though is the blatant pandering to the OT and it's small subset of vocal fans. 
The unwarranted and unrelenting bashing of anything that isn't the OT or the pre SE OT.

False,0,"Talkpages are only used to discuss improvements to the articles they are attached to, not who would win threads or fan theories."

False,0,Discussion is also on the Fallout wikia
False,0,"It's called Discussion, a new feature that is currently under development from Wikia that will eventual turn into a full-fledged forum. The reason this has been implemented is because we at Wookieepedia have no comments sections on our articles, and this is divorced from our main experience."
False,0,"The only spoilers that I have gotten from this wikia was what happened to Ventress in Dark Disciple. As for movie spoilers. The pages where those spoilers would be, are very vague or empty that they tell you nothing that could spoil. "
False,0,"@Dotsie spoilers != leaks.

Leaks happen when something is not yet made public, but someone got a hold of it, and made it public.

Spoilers happen when someone saw something already public, and posted about that also publicly into a community of which a part have not seen it.

Mark Hamill was requesting that, even though some people might be privy to un-released movies, please do not make them public out of schedule."
False,0,"Pages that have spoilers have a big spoiler template at the top, so if you don't want to be spoiled then be sure not to read those!"
False,0,Mark Hamill once said that he doesn't want anyone to leak the next film on the internet (see the article on The force Awakens.)
False,1,"The easy solution is to just avoid the wikia until you see the film. If you can't manage that, then all our pages related to the new film are marked with a special spoilers tag at the top warning you not to read them. There's no need to be concerned about the lockdown as it will only last a few days, after which editing will return as normal. "
False,0,I just don't read cannon articles which is pretty easy considering how many more legends articles there are 
True,1,"Well, this is a Wiki, where we include all spoilers. I am too, concerned about the lockdown, but mainly I just find that it is retarded, as I hate canon, and love Legends."

False,0,"I heard that rumor from the Colider Jedi Council. They think that A) he may return in a flash back, but star wars never has done flashbacks in the past. 
B) as a force ghost
C) as Darth Vader in Rogue One

I'm hoping on C"
False,0,"How would they bring him back though? At the end of his life he converged back to the light side. It is shown that the Sith can create matter out of Midi-chlorians (See Great Experiment) but Anakin manifests in the force. If he was to make a return would he have the knowledge to ""reincarnate"" in a sense? "
False,0,"I hope so TBH. It's funny how when this rumor started. People were all of a sudden ""Ok it's time to let Vader go"". So THAT's where they draw the line at pandering.

But really, if they do. I'll be glad. He wasn't ever a bad actor, EPII wasn't the best (Even though I enjoy it immensely). But based on his performance in EPIII, I welcome that they were willing to go for consistency and bring him back. Anakin Skywalker as a FG could never have been a middle aged man. Nor was Anakin Skywalker ever a Jedi as a middle aged man. It is as Obi-Wan said ""Darth Vader betrayed and murdered your father"". When the glint of light deep inside Vader finally awoke. Anakin Skywalker the Jedi was reborn. So the former visage of himself as a Jedi makes sense as a FG. "
False,0,"Yah, Portman wasn't too amazing in the prequels. Which is weird, because she has done great work in other films. I mean, I think TPM was sort of like near the start of her career, and her better films were later on. "

False,0,"I agree. I'm a new fan, and all that legends literally gave me a migraine the whole day. "
False,0,"I really like Caedus, one of my favorite Sith. But since they made him related to Luke it has to change. I would go crazy if it turned out Kylo was a version of Caedus. I doubt it though. I don't get why people like Katarn so much though. "
False,1,"I thought Finn was the new Kyle Katarn, both are storm troopers gone Jedi. So it makes sense."
False,0,"Ugh, don't remind me. He should've been a key character in Rogue One. If he is reduced to nothing more than a visual cameo or something in Disney Canon. I'll be one huge sad panda.

""But Caedus, Katarn, cloned emperor, all of that is gone. ""

And really only ONE of those things was worth getting rid of.

Caedus is Kylo Ren (Though with his character warped to suit their needs of a vessel for what those OT fans thought Anakin Skywalker was all along and not as TPM or the PT disappointed them. Always some kind of badass, strong in the darkside. Potentially inherently evil though he feels he is doing the ""right"" thing.)

Cloned Emperor, despite now at this point the plausibility of it. Was a strange storyline. Almost up there with turds like Aftermath and The Crystal Star."
False,0,Chances of Katarn returning to the new timeline are slim. But if it happened I would explode from the joy. 
False,3,"I actually like what disney did. The lore got messy because there was conflicting accounts and too much. This time they are rewriting it to make sense. People like Bane and Revan still count I think, because they are to important to cancel. But Caedus, Katarn, cloned emperor, all of that is gone. "
False,2,Don't think so. He is a Legends character. Blame Disney.

"
False,0,Anakin was the most powerful
False,0,I do not believe he was the most powerful. He was the one who brought balance to the force (depending on your point of view); just because he brought balance doesn't mean he was the most powerful imo. 
False,0,"Well, most of the Jedi fell to Darth Vader, and because Obi-Wan almost killed him and was capable of doing so, that would make him the strongest. But that would make Qui-Gon stronger, because he trained Obi-Wan, Dooku stronger because he trained Qui-Gon, and Yoda stronger than all of them,  because he trained Dooku. Plus Yoda trained Luke, who came 2nd closest to killing Vader. That might indicate Yoda being strongest."
False,0,I was always lead to believe that mace windu was the strongest Jedi and some where I read that he would have be above yoda put turned down leading the council to concentrate on his training. 
False,0,"Luke is not the best when it comes to fighting, force affinity, etc. He is just the coolest and most popular. Obi-Wan during the Clone Wars was better and so was Anakin before he was dismembered. Mace Windu, Ki Adi--Mundi, Aayla Secura, Plo Koon, all of these people could beat Episode 6 Luke in a duel. "
False,1,"I think we all know that Anikan Skywalker was the most powerful when he was not robotic Vader. However he was dismembered by Obi Wan on Mustafar and that took away a considerable amount of his midiclhorians. This means his force potential was severely hindered. Like was the closest in terms of raw power to what Anikan Skywalker possessed. We so even though he was unable to defeat the Emperor, you must also realize that he was only about the level of a Jedi Knight during his second and final bout with Vader . This means that despite his raw power in the force he did not have the knowledge needed to possess a great skill set with it. While Vader and the Emperor did . They had years upon years of training plus much more experience in fighting other force welders. Luke had only ever fought his father. I think that Luke was without a doubt the most powerful, it just took him a very long time to get to that point.

False,1,"@Dotsie not necessarily. There might be a ""minimum height requirement"" to be a stormtrooper, and Luke didn't quite make that requirement."

However, I am fully aware that they are not clones, because clones have twice the growth span of people, indicating that by Episode IV, they would be to old to fight. (but that could justify their lousy aim.)
( Lol don't take me seriously on that.)"
False,1,"In Battlefront 2 it was explained that an insurrection on Kamino shortly after the end of the Clone Wars caused the Empire to destroy all Kaminoan clone factories. So instead of creating more clones, the Empire recruited soldiers from all over the Galaxy as well as utilized clones from a couple other templates. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, Jango Fett clones were a minority within the Stormtrooper corps. "

False,1,"The old EU, or ""Legends"", had become a cesspool with good writing, bad writing, and outright toxic writing.

The worst part was that some of the good writing referenced things in the bad- or toxic-writing pool.

Rather than trying to sort out the spaghetti mess, which will still cause a lot of protests anyways, Lucasfilm took the easier -- and much cleaner -- decision to just do away with the whole EU.

Start from a clean slate, and build up from that, under the guidance of the Lucasfilm Story Group.

Besides, the way they de-canonized the old EU, by saying that ""some truths might be found in them thar hills"", allows elements from the old EU to be recanonized into the New Integrated Interconnected Canon. And I am 100% content with that.

(In fact, guessing which elements of Legends will next make it into the New Canon, has become a very enjoyable game for me and some of my friends :D)"

False,0,I think it was Palpatines influence that steered him towards the dark side. It was the deny of rank of master that just put the jedi council on Anakins hit list. 
False,0,But anakin was way too young. I remember obi wan telling him that he should be honored that he was even on the council at such a young age. It was anakin who turned himself to the dark side 
False,0,"An akin was bad to being with he was very outspoken and against the rule and beyond that he had marriage which was looked down upon beside ki adi mundi and plo koon, marriage as a Jedi could lead to the obsession of losing a loved one and anakin was prime example, he could've turned away from padmé and became a powerful Jedi but succumbed to his weaknesses"

Disney fired or let leave 90% of everyone that's been part of Star Wars,Lucas film,I.L.M. took the comic's from Dark Horse and gave them to Marvel,just to make a $ because they own Marvel,And worst of all say 20 year's of expanded universe is no longer canon.

False,0,Luke would win because Anakin obviously can't bring himself to kill his son!
False,0,Anakin would win. 
False,0,I'd say Anakin > before he joined The dark side > he has far more training and altogether talent than Luke 
False,0,"Anakin, because with anger, you can unlock more power and rage"
False,0,Anakin was really fast so I think he could take both of Luke's hands off (including prosthetic) before Luke even blinks.

False,0,Luke
False,1,"
Ever see Luke destroy Jedi temples, slaughter rooms full of people, swing over lava, and nearly defeat one Kenobi (sans being a dumbass)

Remember, Vaders suit was crap.  And given 1983 technology, limited Anakins moves and saber prowess

False,0,I agree 
False,0,"I heard the Lucas once said he regretted killing Maul off so early, as that would have given Kenobi a rival throughout the series ( not to mention the opportunity to see Maul on Genosis going through Jedis and or Clones)

Where it would complicate matters is the Rule of Two, unless of course he was introduced as the assassin and the apprentice as he's defined in Plagues etc.

False,0,One of the problems of the prequels was the lack of a constant villain (besides Sidious). Darth maul should not have been killed that early

False,0,"^Yeah, but that would be a re-hash of the original trilogy rather than a subtle parallel like they had throughout the prequels.

False,0,Dooku Definetly 
False,0,"I wouldn't call Count Dooku underrated so much as underdeveloped. His character is so rushed, and he just springs out of nowhere in Ep. 2. Even in The Clone Wars series he had absolutely no character development or depth. He has a lot of potential and he's a bad-ass duelist, but Lucas and co. really dropped the ball with him."

False,0,The story line isn't the original one. Disney changed it
False,0,"It's impossible for Jar Jar Binks to be a sith Lord. It is obvious the events on Naboo were to put Darth Sidious (Palpatine) into power. The Rule of Two states that there can only be two sith lords: a Master and an Apprentice. Darth Plagues was the master of Palpatine and was killed after Palpatine was put into power. If Jar Jar was the Master, Count Dooku would have been killed by Jar Jar because it is forbidden for the apprentice to have an apprentice (this is what happens in the Force Unleashed videogame, Darth Vader has an apprentice: Starkiller). I am not exactly sure but I believe the order of the clone army by Master Sifo-Dyas (persuaded by Darth Plagueis and his Jedi friend Dooku) was under the administration of the previous Chancellor. Therefore, I believe the clone army was in production during the events of Naboo. Jar Jar Binks, if he was a Sith Lord would have destroyed his apprentice Palpatine, Dooku, and Darth Vader. Jar Jar Binks is said to have still been in the Galactic Senate, so obviously he is still around, but would have perfect access to slaughter both Sith Lords Sidious and Vader. This does not happen. If Jar Jar is indeed a force user, wouldn't he have attempted to defer young Anakin to the dark side early? Anakin is the Chosen One, prophesized to bring balance to the force. Jar Jar Binks would have had the perfect advantage to convert him at a young age."

False,0,"I don't think people understand jar jar binks purpose in star wars he is there to bring some humor to the movies I mean the theory is a little far fetch but you don't have to go all out on jar jar I mean imagine starwars without jar jar and you who hate him might say it will be pretty awesome but and am taking about the PT here would be a little to serious and people would still have arguments about the move and if you think am wrong imagine the OT with out  Han Solo how would that be Jar jar binks is han solo with out a blaster and commonsense.
"
False,0,"It's such a stupid theory, like seriously, Jar-Jar Binks? It was just a stupid meme saying he's the worst sith lord just because he annoyed people the most, but now people are saying he really is? It's just downright stupid..."
False,0,There would be riots. But maybe they're inevitable.
False,0,Is jar jar going to be in the new movie? IF SO. ... Major Fail 
False,0,"Yes, I agree. They should have lasted at least for a few more seconds. Until only Windu and one other were left. Then they would fight sidious together. Just to show how powerful he was. Then somehow, the other was killed while showing compassion or something. And so on"
False,0,I would've have liked to see kit fisto and the two other jedi last for a little while longer but I think them being killed off so soon added to the pace and emotion of those scenes leading up to order 66 and the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader.
False,0,"I would tend to think it showed the power of Sidious, strength of Windo, and the theory that Sideous had foreseen the scenario to get Anakin to turn, so he ""let""  Mace appear to beat him and scar his face 

Also, this can count on  the  list of cinematics and sub three hour time constraints. . . But remember, before then we never saw The Emperor/Sidious with a light saber, nor knew he even had one, then all the sudden he drops three or Jedi, so when you watched it the first time at the midnight showing . . .wow! 


But an large scale battle between them would have been awesome"
False,0,"No, it showed how powerful Sidious is."
False,0,Sidious OP
False,0,"It was surprise. They didn't expect that to happen, and Sidious shielded his thoughts so well that they couldn't predict his actions. And, as skilled as they are, Sidious is much more so. "
False,0,"Yeah they definetely should have made at least Kit Fisto more powerful, we should have seen him in an epic saber fight, what actually happened was very underwhelming "
False,0,"I know how you feel, like you got cheated out of a more epic battle/struggle . Especially since all 4 jedi were of high caliber , not just windu. A surprise attack doesn't quite cut it, especially with weapons drawn out already."
False,0,They had been warned about him though. 
False,0,"Well would you expect some old man who seemed to be friendly to you all the sudden come flying at you with a saber?

No"
False,0,"I think if there was ever a time for ahsoka in live action, it was in the prequel era. 

And I don't see Kanon being in the Saga films. In an Anthology, maybe, but I'm not holding my breath because his story is in Rebels, The Kanon comics and A New Dawn novel, he does cover across more platforms than most characters already"

False,0,Aftermath was an awful book in my opinion..
False,0,"I have, and I'm guessing the second book might focus on Chewie and Han, mostly because of the Falcon on the cover and how Chewbacca owes Han a life debt"

False,0,I have.

I'd avoid Heir to The Empire and beyond.  While good to great, they where done before 1-3 and are missing no known events with extremely extrapolated reasoning.  While needed at the time, now it just doesn't work"
False,0,"Kotor II is a masterpiece, TOR and Zahn's Thrawn books are a waste of time- they're cheesy nonsense.

False,1,"KOTOR's okay, but not great. The Thrawn Trilogy is absolutely the best starting place. From there, just kind of explore what you like most. Since you like the OT, you'll probably like Rebellion-New Republic-New Jedi Order eras, and X-Wing is a good place to start there. Wookieepedia's a great way to research this kind of thing. "
False,0,Play kotor!!!!
False,2,You should read the Thrawn trilogy set right after return of the Jedi. 
False,1,You should try playing Star Wars the old republic great game with great story. It is set during the old republic era.

False,0,In the clone wars we only saw one clone commando so I guess that would mean they are more rare right?
False,0,"NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT! COMPLETE REVERSE OF THAT! ARC troopers are incredibly rare, and extremely skilled. There are only 106 ""true"" ARC troopers (not counting the ones TCW made up like Fives and Echo); six Null-class trained by Kal Skirata, and 100-Alpha class, trained by Jango himself. Clone commandoes, while still extremely skilled, are much more common, with 10,000 in the galaxy. ARC troopers are trained for solo missions, though occasionally work in small groups or in support of non-ARC operations. Commandoes are trained in squads of four, and are rarely separated from their squadmates. "
False,0,I hope that helps. 
False,1,Commandos are much more elite and specialized. Their equipment and armor is much more advanced and they're rarer in the battlefield. Arc's are more common and are just clones with extra training and more elite.
False,0,I heard that JJ Abrams personally buried the bones of Jar Jar Binks in the desert of Jakku. So maybe we see his corpse.  Fingers crossed
False,0,I highly doubt that he will make an appearance. 
False,1,look on jakku. Abrams has said he sneaked his skeleton somewhere in the film
False,0,But if he's a Sith couldn't he have managed to live longer?
False,1,"The odds are very, very slim. A Gungan's lifespan is typically 65 galactic years (not entirely confirmed but has been stated by multiple sources) and according to his Bio he was born 51 BBY which would place him well over his life span in the force awakes. "

False,0,Hoop43 that's a good idea but the timeline doesn't add up cuz the actor is barely 30 and this movie is set 30 years after vader died
False,0,Yeah that's a good idea! ^^
False,0,My guess is somewhere along the line Kylo was an apprentice to Vader. In which he has sought out to avenge him. 
False,0,"Yes his mother died, but Vader could have met another woman during his time on the Empire. "
False,0,"Luke could not possibly have a brother. He was the firstborn twin, and his mother died after he and Leia were born."

False,0,*maul< Dooku 
False,0,Maul was kinda a scrub who could only be used as an assassin. Dooku was far more useful to him. In the legends maul doesn't die either he duels Obi wan in tatooine In the time between revenge of the sith And new hope. In short maul>Dooku

False,0,Maybe they try to rebuild it in exile?

False,0,"Han Solo does not turn to the dark side.
How could you!"
False,0,"For the first comment, Luke does appear in one of the trailers. He is also already considered a Jedi Master come episode 6 and If I recall, in the expanded universe (now legends) they attempt to rebuild the Jedi order and he trains both Han and Leia in the ways of the force and both become jedi along with their kids however Hans son turns to the dark side thus the fall of the whole thing and then Luke goes into exile from his failure.

But again, that's all legend so who know what will come with episode 7."
False,0,And luke is already a jedi
False,0,Leia is force sensitive but i dont think she will become a jedi
False,0,But what about the Jedi Order? They just buzz off and forget about  rebuilding it? I don't think so.
False,0,"That would also explained why Rey and Finn didn't know about the Jedi (besides the ""stories"" Rey had heard, which she didn't seem to initially believe)."

Any idea what's up with Ahsoka's new white lightsabers instead of her yellow/green ones? Does this mean she is a Grey Jedi?? "
False,0,"It's a sure thing that it's possible. We saw her pose as Asajj Ventress with a similar mask as to that of which the lady inquisitor dons in Rebels. We also know she is very good with droids, and Offee is as well. To the point that Asohka didn't recognize her? Well, I'm not sure. Any more thoughts?"
False,2,Probably not. Ahsoka didn't react when she saw her in the most recent episode. Plus I never saw Barriss as being all-out evil. I don't think she would join the Empire.
False,1,Is not her! In the last episode Ahsoka fought her and she didnt even react as if she knew who she was. =) is a new character.
False,1,"She never had dual green sabers, just one green and one yellow shoot"
False,1,I wonder where Ashoka's green dual sabers are
False,0,"I would love to see this twist. Also, with Ashoka's tight relationship with Barriss, it would play our super cool to see one of them show mercy instead of taking their life in a showdown "

For near-invincible armor, a weapon more powerful than the Death Star, a cool name and being cannon this starfighter is the best in the History of the Universe.

Thank you WookieCookies for finding the most OP starfighter in the Galaxy of Star Wars!"
False,0,The sun crusher 
False,0,"Yes but the Interceptor has no shields or hyperdrive making it reliant on Star Destroyers and the X-Wing has been proven to be weaker than other snubfighters like the ARC-170.
Thank you for answering!"
False,0,"Tie interceptor or x-wing starfighter. Both are fast, agile, and heavily armed. The interceptor's biggest advantage is speed and modularity. X-wing is tough and also has a shield."
False,0,"Okay so the First Order TIE Fighter looks just like a TIE Fighter and I do not know enough about it to say anything on the subject.
The Bladewing  (B-Wing) is a very manoeuvrable starfighter  that has been known to singlehandedly destroy entire Victory Class Star Destroyers.
The Skyhopper looks a bit bulky but has proven to be pretty good though I think it's just an atmospherical fighter and that limits it a ton.
Out of the three I'd choose the B-Wing but I already knew of it's existence and It hasn't really convinced me as the best starfighter.
Thanks anyway!

The rest would be canon with this Kylo Ren, Rebels and so on. Our money were good to Lucasfilm, but they still happilly stabbed a dagger in our backs.

False,0,Pardon me but we are not just a tiny fraction!
False,0,"It wasn't a matter of making the continuity work. It was a matter of creating a story that worked for all audiences.

False,1,"Actually, hate break it to you, but it's not just post-Endor that's been tossed. It's the entire EU. Everything that's not the movies, The Clone Wars, and all the stuff they've done. "
False,0,I just reread the 2 Han Solo trilogies again for the first time since I was in college 1996ish.  Man those stories are great.  Hope they don't toss those too.  Disney would paint mouse ears on the Mona Lisa if they owned it.
False,0,Or he is Plagueis who wasn't killed but tricked Palpatine into thinking he killed his master but was really a clone of himself who was sleeping.
False,1,"Two possibilities, he's a entirely new character who I think is a humanoid hybrid of Sith and Dark Jedi, hence the New Order. "
False,0,"Plagueis cheats death, there's your solution"
False,0,Sidious killed Plagueis
False,0,It cant be Darth Plagueis for he is dead. In my opinion it must be someone without training corrupted by a sith spirit
False,0,"No. Repulsorlift vehicles need extra modification in order to hover over water. Airspeeders can, though. "
False,0,I have seen it on the main picture of new patch in Star Wars Commander.
False,0,"Repulsorlift technology is made for solid terrain, although it has been known to sometimes travel on water. I think that an AAT wouldn't be able to as vehicles that hover above water have a special type of engineering."
False,0,"I never heard of that, where did you hear that?"
False,0,Rey; mark my words- Finn is a red herring.
False,0,Finn
False,0,Finn is the Jedi 
False,0,no she just ended her affiliation with the jedi order 
False,0,She already kinda did in the Clone Wars series 
False,0,Why?
False,0,And I think the Jedi are in exile.
False,0,And Luke says a line in a trailer and it sounds nothing like Kylo Ren.
False,0,Ben Skywalker is non-canon. He no longer canonically exists.
False,0,"I'm sure there's something mysterious about luke, since it seems he's not been revealed much yet"
False,0,İt is not possible for me. Because rival for kylo or at least master of kylo must be luke or his Son ben skywalker
False,0,"Almost certainly no. There are now several TV spots, promotional photos and other media that show Adam Driver is clearly the one under Kylo's mask, not Mark Hamill. "
False,0,Jedi order all the way 
False,0,One jedi could kill everyone in call of duty 
False,0,"Jedi would crush the call of Duty, they are far more advanced in tech and the fact that they could use the force.  "
False,0,Close call. But Rebels would lose.
False,0,Unsc easily
False,0,Love this discussion.
False,0,"Everyone should bane, I thought he revived the old order of two after finding with artifacts and scrolls?"
False,0,Didn't he create the order of two
False,0,I have heard of it. From master yoda
False,0,Hello
False,0,"Forget canon. In Legends, Windu shatters a Hurrikane native crystal-being. "
False,0,Maybe it's just a rare variant of a power crystal?
False,0,"The short comics ""Stones"" shows Mace shattering part of an alien by accident to get his crystal if I remember correctly. The story was literal in legends, but the origin of Mace's lightsaber crystal in canon hasn't been confirmed.  "
False,0,I dont think so be Cause only two gifted to wield the forces were Yoda and ben Kenobi according to trilogy it has to be cleared that master windu was dead
False,0,He should survive maul got cut in half so he should come back
False,0,"Yeah getting your hand cut off, being electrocuted and being through off the top of a building is pretty bad but he is a Jedi, I think he would be but we really won't know. The great thing about it is if you want to think he survived its your dedication 😉"
False,0,"Even though he wouldn't be dead from that fall, he'd probably have died of old age already"
False,0,"I am sure he is dead, although Disney has a history of reviving dead characters, he seemed super-dead in episode 3"
False,0,"When Maul came back in TCW, Disney didn't own star wars then. Plus that was at the request of Lucas himself. As for Ahsoka, she is Filonis character that only he can touch"
False,0,Darth Maul coming back was before Disney.
False,0,"I have to disagree with you, Hyger3. I don't think Rebels feels like Star Wars at all. I think it feels like utter misery. "
False,1,"Darth Maul came back before Disney acquired Star Wars, and George Lucas and Dave Filoni discussed the possibility of Ahsoka being involved in the Rebel Alliance before the show ended and before Disney acquired Star Wars. That being said, I have enjoyed most of the returns we've seen so far."
False,1,Wasn't the clone wars before Disney?
False,0,If Windu came back he'd have to be a dark sider. Otherwise it would just be Yoda all over again.
False,0,And i hope mace windu comes back
False,0,Fives is my top 3 saddest deaths
False,0,I hope echo comes back
False,0,"Well, whole Rebels are about this. But this is Filoni's problem, too. That guy can hardly create something original. That's why Rebels has SW feel - because it recycles the OT and uses old characters,"
False,0,Dead
False,0,"Did Darth Sidious learn how to bring people back from the dead? If so, did Vader learn this? Could be why the rumours about Hayden Christian returning."
False,0,Only Darth Plagueis can bring people back to life and he's dead
False,0,No he's dead
False,0,I won't :P
False,0,"Wow. How can sex and lekku get mixed up? Actually, don't answer."
False,0,"I can imagine some advantages, but they are 18+ plus :D"
False,0,"And, DarthKrath, at least it's something more interesting to talk about than the usual ""omg I'm so excited Episode VII is almost here"" stuff. "
False,0,"It really depends on the species. Togruta montrals are hollow, and aid in sensing vibrations, a little like echolocation. Nautolan tendrils are extremely sensitive olfactory organs, especially underwater. Twi'lek lekku are basically like having a prehensile tail. Etc"
False,0,"If you take the time to read the page about Lekku and twi'leks it will tell you, there's no need to clog the message board up when you can read it on the wiki you're posting on. "
False,0,Same
False,0,Same 
False,0,Kotor II
False,0,Kotor without a doubt
False,0,But that plot twist 
False,0,"I believe the prequels have a tiny bit of edge on KOTOR, minus Jar Jar and Padmé Amidala's fashion choices; and her politic choices; and marriage choices. 
Every choice let's all face it. "
False,0,Well the unsc soligers have better training but bad armor clones can reproduce by the second so in that factor clones win but dont forget odst and spartans they could kill jedi and unsc bullets are not laser so they cant deflect them in a ground battle unsc air battle star wars
False,0,Ohh thanks 
False,0,The military from the Halo Universe. 
False,0,What is the unsc?
False,0,"Assuming you're talking about the Grand Army of the Republic (The Clones), they're both pretty equal in terms of firepower and skill. 
From what I understand, the UNSC would be smaller than the Grand Army, so there's a factor that the Republic wins out on. 
I think it would really be down to what kind of equipment the Spartans have; if they have armor that can resist a lightsaber, then UNSC. If they don't, the Republic based off of the mere fact that Jedi and Spartans are equal in combat prowess, but Jedi can block bullets; Spartans can't keep from being dismembered. It would be a crazy epic war though. "
False,0,Unsc 
False,0,Is it sensible for Leia to become a Jedi and them both being in exile?
False,0,I Agreement with New republic
False,0,He will be shown very little. But in second Movie he will be in main ı think. They will  ruin Everything luke will clean this mess 
False,0,We're does it say that? 
False,0,Really I didn't know that
False,1,New republic 
False,0,"No I mean like, empire or rebel"
False,0,His actor is listed in the cast so I think so 
False,0,Or scarier......chewwie
False,0,that's probably Han Solo
False,0,"It's possible, but unlikely. John Boyega has been confirmed to play Finn throughout the trilogy, and if the scene of Rey crying is in fact of her crying over Finn, it's more likely that he gets injured in the fight against Kylo Ren than actually killed. "
False,0,That depends on where you live. In my country - nowhere :(
False,0,Barnes & Noble has some 
False,0,Darth Revan
False,0,Darth Bane 
False,0,"First: The Jar-Jar guy is obviously a troll.
Second: Boba Fett or Fynn Shysa."
False,0,Obi-Wan Kenobi oh and Jar-Jar
False,0,Dooku or Aayla Secura 
False,0,HAN SOLO!!!!!!
False,0,"Obi-Wan, Malgus, and Palpatine. Oh and Dooku"

False,0,Han Solo or Palpatine
False,0,Darth malgus and anakin oh and han solo
False,0,Me!!!!
False,0,YYYYEEEESSSSS!!!!!!!!
False,0,"You would say he is the best, being yourself married to him. But Boba is waaaaay cooler. Han is just more charismatic."
False,0,He is the best cant lie besides obi wan
False,0,No
False,0,No the actor for Kylo ren is a different actor
False,0,"He is the son of Leia and Han...this will be revealed by a flashback, when his parents bring him to Lukes Academy. "
False,1,And have you seen anything about the new movie or looked up imdb it tells you who the actors are
False,0,No kylo ren was born after thw battle of endor
False,1,"Finn is obviously going to be outmatched. But im unsure of how hes even able to use a lightsabre in the first film. Luke didn't in his first apperance. Hes never sabre in his life (im assuming so from Hans talk to the two newbies on the falcon.) He'll be overpowered easily. The question is, who will save him? That I am looking forward to."
False,2,"Finn a Jedi? Yes. First conflict between Flinn and Ren? Typical Ren overpowers Finn, Finn obviously outmatched and is either saved, hopefully by Luke! Or some diversion takes Ren's attention away from Finn so he can escape. "
False,1,"I think Luke will teach Finn the way of the jedi after his planetfall and meeting Rey. But its a question where and when will he fight Kylo Ren - I think he will lose, but Rey will somehow save him. "
False,2,I hope it's like the fight be Maul and Quigon
False,2,"What if the Jedi way is what Finn decides to fight for? Like, he had nothing to fight for, and then he had something, and that's why he fights. What if there's something (or maybe someone) that he decides to fight for?"
False,1,I think Rey is the one that will become the Jedi. In the trailer she seamed to be missing a role to me. And Finn was the storm trooper that had nothing to fight for.
False,0,That would be awesome if Luke came to fight Kylo! Luke would show him quite a few tricks.
False,1,What if Luke saves Finn? 
False,2,"Yes, and it will be awesome!"
False,2,"Yeah, I have the feeling that Finn may be a fake out, and he's just carrying the lightsaber. He can possibly hold his own with it to a certain extent just through previous combat training as a stormtrooper."
False,0,"While in Legends, Boba Fett was a Mandalorain, within canon it has been confirmed by Pablo Hidalgo that Fett isn't a member of the group.
https://twitter.com/pablohidalgo/status/672452120424017920"
False,0,"It's spelled Mand'alor! You're not even mandalorian are you?!
Anyway, Boba Fett will always be Mandalore's Mand'alor. 
He saved us from the Yuuzhan Vong and has been the best Mand'alor since Fenn Shysa!"
False,2,Would be sweet keeping him with the old canon of becoming mandalore
False,0,It'd be a heck of a lot better than anything Disney'll do. Worse than the kriffing Corporate Sector…

False,1,None. 
False,0,"Yeah, I agree with all of that. I mostly posted this to see if there were any people who have more than a basic understanding of Star Wars who actually agree with the theory. "
False,0,Does JarJar really seem to have the capability and medichlorians to be a Sith?
False,0,It is the least plausible theory ever. They just made it up to make jar jar haters happy
False,1,"I think that may have been the original idea for the character, but within the Star Wars universe it has none. "
False,0,I think its all a rumor but people have great evidence that he could be

False,0,"We actually do have those! You can find one for Grey here: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/CC-10/994 and Styles here: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Styles They could both still use some updates, so feel free to add more information."
False,0,Like 90+
False,0,Plus he would be really really old
False,0,Mace dead.
False,0,"The only way we would see Mace Windu is if it were a vision or something of that nature, but we most likely will not see him. "
False,0,Well we all thought that darth maul died to but he came back in the clone wars. 
False,0,"Correct, Mace Windu is long since dead so he will not be appearing in the new films."
False,0,Mace windu died during order 66
False,0,Everyone who has been following the news thinks he is
False,0,"I bet it's Sifo-Dyas severely disformed after his ""death"""
False,0,it's possible to be Jar Jar binks there are many theories about that
False,0,"I think it's plausible. Although I don't see why Plagius would have chosen this time to take over, when this (the New Order) is literally the Imperial remnants in all but name. Why now? Yeah Palpatine was in the way, but the Empire had the vast majority of the galaxy under their fist. People are saying its because Plagius could not have taken bith Vader and Sidious at the same time: but they were rarely around each other - Vader was off with the 501st quelling rebellion. Aarrghhh anyways... I like the idea personally. Not sure if it's true though."
False,0,"Rey, autocorrect is such a pain"
False,0,"The writers of the new film confirmed that caedus is non cannon in the new film, 

It's why the new lead try is thought to be Han and lead daughter,

I still want to know where mark hamil's Luke is, he did say he always wanted to be a site in his last interview, him being a dark side would be pretty sick
"
False,0,Supreme leader snoke is kylo rens master. Also supreme leader snoke might be darth plageuis 
False,0,I think maybe darth caedus might show up and he might be the sith for the next movies 
False,1,Looking for some serious character progression with Kylo - hoping for some deep backstory and a good logical journey into either Sith prominence or a turn to the Jedi
False,3,"I absolutely love this topic. Here is my two cents lol, I believe Kylo will soon become a Sith Lord seeing as he possess powers for such things already. However, I do not foresee him being the top tier Sith Lord like Palpatine, more or less like Vader since he wants to ""finish what he started"". I do believe there will be a higher power revealed on the same level of Palpatine and I believe that to be Darth Maul. Since most know or should know, he did not die in the first movie. He comes back in the Clone Wars cartoon series and Palpatine tells him he will be of good use later then after, to my knowledge the cartoon was canceled after with no continuation of Darth Maul. Then I did some research on his race: Darthomirian. He is 100% even though having a human mother (that kinda baffled me). But since he was 100%, they can live to up to 100 years. Darth Maul was born 51 BBY and after doing all the math, that would put him at roughly 90 years in the next trilogy and for being dormant all these years he could be training and developing his skills to be perfect. So I really see it as Darth Maul will be the next top tier villain. 

Plus with Anikin, Yoda and Obi-Wan as ghosts for Luke, they all have greater knowledge of his existence."
False,1,He is one of the leaders in the first order but he is also a member of the knights of Ren. He could have his own agenda aside from the first order.
False,0,I think he will be the main villain throughout the trilogy because he wants to finish what Darth Vader started. Plus he's awesome and carries one of the coolest lightsabers. 
False,0,"I think he's going to be like Lumiya, not a true sith at first, but eventually becomes one. I'm hoping he's going to kill Snole in the trilogy, and take an apprentice."
False,0,Well right now kylo isnt a sith becuase he doesnt have the title darth but i think there is somthing or someone like a real sith that will appear in 8 and 9
False,1,"Legends will always be fact and no one can change that. Not Disney, not Lucas, no one. I mean, they're like 90% of the Star Wars universe."
False,1,"Also, if you happen to still believe in Legends, lightsabers are energy. No plasma involved. "
False,1,"It's utter stupidity. He'd be more likely to roast his own face off than do anything effective. And if they's ""exhaust vents"" like Disney says, they wouldn't be able to block anything. "
False,0,"It's a very stupid hilt. But not that bad as Inquisitor's saber, than can't even work."
False,0,Well they weren't intended for hand guards at all. Kylo built his own saber with no knowledge what-so-ever and those are exhaust ports given that the crystal in the hilt is so unstable giving that flaring look to them. I can't source anything for this but I believe it to be more accurate than just hand guards. I'm sure if you check out a page about the crystals on here it'll explain the significance of an unstable one.
False,0,For coolness' sake
False,0,"My guess is it's to protect the wielder's hand from the energy of the two smaller blades. The blade is, according to a recent source, of an ancient design and the two smaller blades are energy exhaust, so the hilt is probably there to protect the wielder."
False,0,*raises hand to agree*
False,0,"Long live EU! Death to Disney!

(Then when the film comes out and is perfect I'll deny ever saying this)"
False,0,"You can say whatever you want, the fact is that the EU is the most complex universe ever created, and it will be hardly beaten."
False,1,And that's why I refuse to don the mouse ears. I remain loyal. 
False,1,"I think that the EU (Legends, whatever) is the greatest example of a constructed universe ever created. Every background character has a name and a story. Every ship and weapon has a tale. Star Wars, to me, isn't about having something entertaining to read when I feel like it (though it is that, too). It's about exploring a whole new, fantastic universe, with endless depth and information. "
False,1,Pretty sure he works for the disney....lol
False,4,It's hard to keep track of some things and characters but I can't get enough of it.
False,0,Is it just me who thinks snoke might turn out to be darth plagueis?
False,0,Isn't this why they're releasing the movie?
False,0,Probably too soon to tell. I bet Snoke will last until at least Episode IX.
False,0,Lost Stars. It's a great way to refresh your memory of the original trilogy without watching the same movies again
False,0,Han Solo trilogy were really fun books 
False,0,"Ok, so, I want to start from the beginning and read towards now. "
False,0,"""нan ѕolo: ѕмυgglerѕ rυn "" ιѕ aмazιng "
False,1,"Darth Matman, there is no reason not to read or watch legends materials. True they are not cannon now, but if there is no conflict then there is no reason to say it didn't happen. Side note to question asked Thrawn trilogy is fantastic."
False,1,"If you are wanting to do so to find out more about the Star Wars universe then I am sad to say that majority of the novels are no longer canon. When the new movie was announced it was also announced that much of what was canon is no longer canon. The main things that are canon are the movies, the battle of the clones series, and the force unleashed games. I strongly disagree with this but sadly, that is the way it is."
False,0,Lost Stars also exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend. 
False,1,"X-Wing series, Darth Bane trilogy, Thrawn trilogy."
False,2,the darth bane trilogy is really good 
False,0,"Aftermath and the other novels in the Journey to The Force Awakens series are definitely a good place to start if you want to start seeing the story that leads into Episode VII. A New Dawn is also a good place to start, since that was the first book of the new canon. It's a prequel to Star Wars Rebels."
False,1,"Ignore the stupid ""reshaping the Force"" osik. Disney canon is idiotic. Basically, the Tarkin Doctrine is about ruling through fear. The Rebellion is successful only through the ""stateless philosophy"" in which it never holds actual significant territory, and instead wages guerrilla warfare, hiding out on countless planets. The purpose of the Death Star was to make the cost of sheltering Rebels so severe that no planet would dare to do so. "
False,0,There's no reason other than bachelor pad. You hit it spot on. Mon mothma would go there and whore around some of the main hangars for fresh imperial men.
False,1,"To put it simply, if you were able to create a machine to give you the ability to blow up a planet, wouldn't you?"
False,1,"The novel Star Wars: Tarkin started to shed some light on that. Other than being a military tool to keep order and try to scare systems into being loyal to the Empire, the book hinted that it was part of the Emperor's plans to control the Force and reshape it to his liking."

False,0,*if you haven't already 
False,0,Yo if you guys like darth plagueis you would read the book on him 
False,0,I agree with the plagueis theory since Palpatine is known for being a faker and a lier he could have lied about killing his former master in his sleep
False,1,I really want it to be darth plagueis. there is a lot of stuff pointing to it being him. but most likely it won't be him 
False,0,"I'm really interested to see who he is too. I think J.J. Abrams said he was a practitioner of the dark side of the Force. Part of me wonders if he's the mysterious fleet admiral we saw at the end of ""Aftermath."""
False,0,Very nice points there James
False,1,"Abrams is a phenomenal director, I couldn't tell you a work I am not always being one uped by with him and keep in mind, Lucas is still a producer so he's not going to let the production go to shit and the writers for this film are new except for 2 or 3 of them which worked on the original trilogy and have written for the EU since the beginning. I believe it'll do fine."
False,0,I think you're right. The Force Awakens might possibly be the best Star Wars film. 
False,1,Maybe people are just overreacting and this will be the best one yet.
False,2,"It's not JJ I'm worried about, it's Disney."
False,1,"Plus with how close together the release of each film is, I don't think J.J. Abrams could have realistically managed post-production on Episode VII and pre-production on Episode VIII at the same time."
False,1,"From all the trailers and insider reports it sounds like he did a great job. That said I like how each film has a different director, one who can bring their own distinctive style to the film - especially Rian Johnson, who will probably make a very different Star Wars movie than we're used to. The original trilogy had three different directors and that was successful, so I'm optimistic about what the three directors of this trilogy will do."
False,0,She'll be like Yoda was in the OT
False,1,I believe the next Jedi will be Maz Kanata. 
False,0,Disney took a big old steamy poop on the new order and the rest of the cannon.  The writers will not use any characters that they themselves haven't created or haven't already been seen on film.  All print characters are dead.  R.I.P. Talon Karde
False,0,Definitely think Rey is on the path to becoming a Jedi
False,0,I agree with brandon. I hope that luke started the new jedi order.
False,0,"I wouldn't be surprised if there were already some Jedi with Luke by the time we see him in the movie. But in terms of the main characters, my guess is that Rey will end up becoming a Jedi. She seems like she's going to be the new main character of this trilogy."
False,0,"If you do not know, read the wiki page. If there is nothing on it, we do not know, there is only speculation "
False,0,"Rex, Wolffe, and Gregor all went on to live in a modified AT-TE walker on the planet Seelos. They met up with the rebels about 15 years after the clone wars ended."
False,0,"We don't know where he was yet or if he knows what happened to Anakin, but I'm guessing we'll find out more as season 2 progresses. "
False,0,I remember that. But where was he during the order 66? And did he know Anakin is Vader?
False,0,He removed his chip after one of the other clones when crazy and killed a Jedi in the last season. So did a few other clones. I believe it is the first episode of seasons 6 and it follows on for the next few episodes
False,0,Kylo Ren is not a sith. He is one of the Knights of Ren. A next step evolution of the sith. But with new laws
False,0,No. The Sith are dead and gone.
False,0,We need more Darth
False,0,I hope so
False,0,Well Jacen Solo becomes Darth Caedus in 40 ABY force awakens is set in about 33 ABY so unless the sixth stopped it and brought it back then I don't see why not 
False,0,I think it would be cool if a new Sith wouldn't have this title. But people probably will want them to have it.
False,2,"I think they should, but not at first. I'm hoping Kylo Ren follows in Lumiya's footsteps and resurrects the Sith."
False,0,"Darth Maul. Darth Tyranus. Darth Sidious. Darth Vader. Darth Darth Darth. There's too many of them! In my opinion, if there are any Sith in the new trilogy, they should not call themselves Darth. There was a time when Darth was not a title, but rather a first name; Darth Vader was the character's name, not his title. That's why Obi-Wan called him ""Darth."" Over time, though, Darth evolved to be a title, which we first saw with Darth Maul, but there are plenty of Sith in Legends stories who don't use that title. Ajunta Pall, Marka Ragnos, Freedon Nadd, and so forth. I want to see the movies do something new, with a character whose name is just their name, not a Darth title. I think that can help humanize the character, when you know them as a distinctive personality rather than just yet another in a long line of people with the same name that looks like the writers are trying to cash in on Darth Vader's pop culture status."
False,0,I hope not
False,0,The character handing the saber to Rey is the ancient alien Maz Kanata. She will be a Yoda type character voiced by Noyong'o and played by a Henson Studio Muppet.
False,0,That would be cool but doubtful
False,0,she could be the person who is talking to rey in the trailer and the one who hands her the lightsaber but who knows 
False,0,"Probably not. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a reference to animated characters in Rogue One, though. Maybe a nod to ""Commander Tano"" or ""Captain Syndulla."""
False,0,"No way, Disney/Lucas Film announced that there will be no character appeared in movies, who was first introduced in animated series or comics. At the same time I have a feeling that Ahsoka will die in this or the next season of STR."
False,1,That would be so cool it was so sad when she left the Jedi order in the clone wars and in the new season rebels her story continues...
False,0,We might becuase she did survive order 66 
False,0,"Please, no."
False,0,That would be so cool
False,0,Cause I can give it!
False,1,"The most powerful side is the Grey side.
Jensaarai are able to defeat Sith and Jedi alike because they understand them and have both sides of abilities.

False,1,"The Dark Side is the quick and easy way to potentially near-limitless power. But if you instead choose to invest the time and discipline needed to master the Light Side of the Force, you can be just as powerful, but at less cost to your own being. "
False,0,"I think it's less ""The Dark side offers more power quickly but the light side is more powerful if you stay true/are redeemed"" and more ""The Dark side has more brute-force power, but in order to effectively use said powers you must embrace destructive tendencies that commonly kill off the Sith; Anger, Aggression, Fear, Obsessive passion, etc., while the Light side offers the same amount of power (depending on the ""Balance of the Force"" I suppose), but not at the expense of your life or happiness."".
   "
False,0,the darkside offers more power quickly but the lights takes more time. both have pros and cons but the darkside can be more powerful because it is faster to gain power 
False,0,You become more powerful on the dark side becuase your not affraid to use it to your own desire. And the force is so strong within the dark side that the sith is able to stop people from dying
False,0,You become more powerful on the dark side becuase your not affraid to use the force for your own desire.
False,0,"You are the most powerful, if you understand both sides. You have to join the dark side and the come back."
False,0,I think you gain new powers when joining  the dark side but won't necessarily be more powerful unless you learn control while being able to resist the dark side takes control and strength you still won't have all the powers of a sith so power wise you joining the dark side would be the way to go. Unless your yoda ;)
False,0,DARTH BANE
False,0,Yeah chaotic dragon 
False,0,I would say Raven he has slated many enemies and armies so yeah
False,0,"Revan is known as Revanchrist, basically a God of the force, in my opinion he would win."
False,0,And bane had his obalisk armor
False,1,"The main part Both of you are missing is which Revan and which Bane. Just saying Revan, without saying what part of his life and the same with Bane, is nothing. I am also seeing very little backing to your claims. 
Bane destroyed and created a sith order, amassed a collection of force history/teachings, and managed to hold his own against powerful Jedi and other beings"
False,0,"Revan slew entire armies, was both Jedi and Sith, and could nearly defeat the Sith emperor. I personally think he is more powerful in nearly every aspect and he would win."
False,0,But once it come to Sabres Bane will slice right through him
False,0,"Revan, he fought and defeated greater opponents than Bane."
False,0,Books written in first person suck
False,0,That would be an awesome idea! It's Star Wars it would sell very well. 
False,0,"I've read Their to the Jedi, which inspired me to write this, and thus takes place later than that, and will feature Boba Fett, just to further a good reception from the fans. Thanks for your thoughts."
False,0,"You can always publish it for free on the internet, as fan fiction."
False,0,"Already exists, it's called ''Heir to the Jedi''. And I don't think Lucasfilm accepts unsolicited novels from fans."
False,0,I'd buy it
False,0,"so. this was the last large scale battle before the rebellion and empire split stopped fighting and split the galaxy. Han and chewie get captured and both sides face devastating losses. this is what the battle of jakku is on star wars battlefront. rey is a baby and she gets taken by the empire and is brought to max von sydows character, who is the commander of a star destroyer. his star destroyer crashes on jakku and both he and rey survive. the empire doesn't send reinforcements to pick them up he renounces the empire and starts a colony of sorts with the rest of the imperial troops. this quickly attracts scavengers and Raiders to the downed star destroyer. this is what rey is doing in the trailer "
False,0,I think she's Luke Skywalker's daughter. I'm excited to find out the truth.
False,0,"She is not in Tatooine, but in Jakoo"
False,0,*tatooine
False,0,Han and Leia.
False,0,"It's a mystery, theories say that she is the daughter of Han and Leia. Not confirmed yet. She is on Jakku"
False,0,The power to buy out all competitors. 
False,1,It looks like he sort of melts their brain from the inside from what I see 
False,0,He just has to play dirty like the rest of them. 
False,0,All Sith and Jedi have mind manipulation. He is just determined to unleash the sith souls that Luke guards.
False,0,Perhaps telepathy
False,0,"Kreia, Darth Bane and Jolee Bindo."
False,1,Darth Malgus
False,1,Although I do have to say that I'm somewhat of a fan of Kyp Durron.
False,1,"I was never really into the post-RotJ EU although some of the characters and concepts were interesting. The pre-phantom menace eu I love almost more than the movies. My favorite eu character would have to be someone from the old republic era, maybe Bane or Revan "
False,1,"Torn between Thrawn, and Revan"
False,1,Darth Malgus 
False,2,Darth star killer from dark side edition of Force unleashed 2
False,1,"Brandon Rhea - for me it is canon, but I really don't care what is canon and what isn't. There are bad things in both the EU and canon, and same goes for the good things. As for me, I take official Disney canon as an alternate universe. But this is offtopic, and every non-casual SW fan knows the difference."
False,1,Quinlan Vos
False,0,Fives (clone wars)
False,0,"That's what I'm guessing. And yes sorry, forgot the name. "
False,0,"I think the Acolytes of the Beyond probably have something to do with the Knights of Ren. Maybe they become the Knights of Ren? They seem to worship Darth Vader and that's what Kylo Ren does, so there definitely seems to be an implied connection."
False,0,Acolytes of the Beyond you mean? 
False,0,"JAR JAR
MORE JAR JAR
Actually, due to speculation, one could deduce that the Antagonist of TFA could be either Darth Plaguis-I doubt it-,Sifo-Dyas-my personal guess or a prominent character from the background. "
False,0,"Some speculate that ""Darth"" is an overused term, and it will be much more interesting with a change like that."
False,0,He is a knight of ren 
False,0,The obviously he is not a Sith Lord only two can the be
False,0,"I think that the ""first order"" is a legion of storm troopers that are force users. "
False,0,I agree but I did some research and he is part of the nights of ren 
False,0,"""Ren"" is the Knights of Ren equivalent to ""Darth"" of the sith. While Kylo Ren isnt technically sith, the Knights are an organization with similar motives from the dark side of the force."
False,0,"Kylo is only a puppet. He has no idea what is he doing, and will pay for it. He is too weak for a villain, and a Revan-like mask won' save it."
False,0,"I think The Knights of Ren are just another force organization that allied with the First Order. If I'm not mistaken, then none of the other knights have lightsabers. I heard kylo ren's was just a modification to Darth Vader's because not many people left in the galaxy know how to create one. I think he is special and maybe the leader of them. It also might be a bit of a Darth Maul character and die in the first movie of the trilogy. Idk but I'm excited for the movie!!!
"
False,0,"Agreed! He's definitely not a Sith. (SPOILER ALERT) Whatever the Knights of Ren are they're definitely something else, but Kylo for sure seems motivated by the legacy of Darth Vader."
False,1,I think kylo ren is trying to avenge Darth Vaders Death bt rebuilding the sith order
False,0,"I've said this a lot, but I think Luke and Leia both become Jedi and go into exile."
False,0,no. he doesn't. after a final battle with the empire he loses friends and a large portion of the rebels. without obi wan or yoda for guidance he renounces the force and supposedly becomes a hermit on tatooine. but then he comes back. he is NOT kylo ren 
False,0,"No way!! In TROTJ, he realized that the light side is better than the dark and at the same time that the LS brings piece to the world, but the DS destroys the world. So I really doubt it!"
False,0,"Extremely doubtful. My guess is he is in hiding from his previous student that turned to the dark side, Kylo Ren"
False,0,Not sure but it's very possible because in episode 6 he dose she what it's like but I doubt it
False,0,"Only time will tell! I doubt it, though."
False,0,My tears
False,0,Kylo Ren and the First Order! 
False,0,I do wanna see if the movie added ANY EU aspects. I can't bear to see the universe be discarded. 
False,0,I want to see what Luke does and I want to see the new droid BT-8
False,0,Hard to believe it's less than two weeks away. (I have a pre-ordered ticket to an early December 17 showing.) Feels like it just sorta crept up. I don't know that there's really one particular thing I'm aching to see - I'm just really hoping to enjoy the whole film.
False,1,Wanna see what happens to Luke. A lot of speculation that he may have fallen to the dark side in some way and he hasnt been seen in any of the trailers (except for one quick shot of a hooded Luke with R2).
False,0,And it's only two weeks here :P
False,0,"Not going to watch this movie, muhahaha."
False,0,"I have a guess as to part of the plot, and can't wait to see if I'm right."
False,3,I wonder if Leia is a jedi like in the old EU ...
False,0,"Very true Vathrein, very true."
False,0,"At the Battle of Galidraan, Jango killed five Jedi with nothing but his bare hands. Spartans are nothing next to Jedi. And Boba is arguably even more skilled than his father. "
False,0,No contest. Either one of the Fetts alone could kill a dozen Spartans. 
False,1,"Maul's lightsaber has four separate crystals, not one. Using ACTUAL lightsaber mechanics (not that Disney osik), it would be physically impossible for one crystal to focus two blades in opposite directions. Crystals don't power the lightsaber, they just focus the energy of the power cell into a blade. Maul's lightsaber runs on two separate power cells, the energy of each of which is focused by two focusing crystals. Obi-Wan's lightsaber severed one of the power cells, disabling that side of the lightsaber, but the other was still intact. "
False,0,There is a crystal for each blade
False,5,"It presumably has two crystals, which is why Maul was also able to use a single blade. Both ends activated independently of one another, so cutting the hilt down the middle wouldn't cut the crystal in half."
False,0,It's like killing a snake. Cut off the head it will still bite
False,0,As with most things in Episode I
False,1,Probably didn't put a lot of thought into 
False,0,Because we like to put mouse ears and huge checks everywhere and call it kid-friendly. 
False,0,Because the blaster is charged from the crystal and it's not powerful enough to make a blast that can actually kill.
False,0,He doesn't like to hurt people
False,0,"He's a kid, he probably doesn't want to kill. But I'd like to see getting him killed :D"
False,0,"Please keep your comments civil, Moboggie. Thanks."
False,0,Cause he's a Disney bitch
False,0,"We've never seen him kill before, I don't think he would kill if he had the chance. "
False,0,How do you download it
False,0,It's true like Parma amadala I love her and her outfits 
False,0,What do you mean?
False,0,"Droids can be force sensitive only in extended universe, not in canon."
False,0,They know their coming they act surprised to trick the droids in thinking that they are dome
False,0,YES
False,0,I am sure Luke is the dark master of Kylo Ren. In one of the trailers kylo does not wear the mask and he's not Luke. But Luke must be his master
False,0,I think he will be a figure like Obi-wan... A guy off the records and chased by the empire!
False,0,"I don't think that Luke will be Kylo Ren, because:
1.He is the master of the new Jedi Order.
2.He hasn't got any reasons for it.
"
False,0,"I do believe the theory of Han being more of a main character, especially because he is seen more in promotional materials and because I believe that Leia became a Jedi, And because the Empire (or at least the First order) exists, she is probably in exile (along with Luke) so Han is seen more, and that also would give him a more interesting back story for the director to work off of. Just my opinion, and I'm not entirely sure how true it actually is."
False,1,With frankwolf he is the chosen one and also you don't see his name in starting you see Harrison ford so maybe Han is the main character 
False,0,I would agree 
False,0,I don't know I have been wondering that too.
False,0,Kylo Ren... He's Kylo Ren.
False,0,Would you consider quilan vos a grey Jedi 
False,1,"They just want to hype it up, nothing else. This will be Han's movie, not Luke's."
False,0,Ahsoka is awesome!!!  Great to see her in action again
False,0,"Andrewrozell - it aired on Disney XD last night. I watched it on watchdisneyxd.com. You can also get on iTunes right now, I think, if you have an Apple account.

Starborngirl - totally agreed!"
False,0,"I found the fact that they had to babysit the babies hilarious. It was also amazing when Ahsoka fought, I didn't realise I was holding my breath u till it was over. It was a heartwarming yet serious episode- I loved it! Plus with Ezra's slip up we're bound to see more action soon!"
False,0,Where are you watching it? 
False,0,Darth dingleberry says yes 
False,0,Yes I'm going to preorder tickets for the midnight premiere 
False,2,"Nope, I'll read about the plot on Wookieepedia."
False,1,I am seeing it in the first day! :)
True,1,Will be there opening day as well. Super excited! 
False,1,Wouldn't miss it. Can't wait!
False,1,On opening day!! Can't wait.
False,1,Yep! 
False,1,Yes!
