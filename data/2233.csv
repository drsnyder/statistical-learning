False,0,Plus he really doesn't like defending himself and will willingly take blows just to give out punishment. 
False,0,Moon Knight is my favorite superhero and I don't like Batman so it pains me to say this but Batman would win cause Batman has a black belt in every martial art in the world plus he'll use gadgets and stuff while Moon Knight will try to fight straight up.
False,0,Read the entry of Red Skull in this Wikia
False,0,Howard The Duck
False,0,Yo mama
False,0,Ant Man and Vision 
False,0,Ant-man
False,0,The vision
False,0,Howard Stark and Hank Pym.
False,0,Doctor strange and Wasp
False,0,You forgot ant man. He was in the trailer but he was so small to the point where you probably couldn't see him.
False,0,Ithi nk it was Oziris in anicent Egypt(Read Shiels comic byJona than Hickman)
False,0,The whole history of the organization (Earth-616) in  the comic-book S.H.I.E.L.D #9 of this year
False,0,"Well, it was a branch off from the SSR. & It was founded by Peggy Carter, Howard Stark, & Chester Phillips after World War II when they defeated HYDRA. (This is all according to the MCU, I don't know if it's different in Earth-616)."
False,0,Nick fury. SR
False,0,I think Peggy Carter and Howard Stark started S.H.I.E.L.D sometime shortly after the time Steve went into the ice and the war ended. They started it to protect people from things like the Tesseract. 
False,0,If Marvel is involved it might be good. But FOX is always hit or miss with me. I wish Marvel had the rights to X-Men/mutants.
False,1,Fox were the guys that made the horrible Fan4 reboot
False,0,I look forward to the hellfire show
False,0,I heard it won't tie into the movies. Don't really plan on watching
False,0,Bucky will be the new cap
False,0,If Steve dead during civil war Bucky will be new captain (on comics).
False,0,"I doubt it... It seems like they want to move forward with falcon as the new cap, but hey, thats just my opinion!"
False,0,Yes 100% 
False,1,Ben reily
False,0,"Personally, Ben is my favorite."
False,1,"With Kaine theres the killing which, is a plus, but not funny, Ben was awesome though, being Peter's ""brother"" shows them having a good bond."
False,0,"I have been reading marvel comic since I was 10 ( I am 51!!!) and have to say that the story line of pretty much all the characters is getting way too complicated and confusing.
For Spider-Man in particular , I miss those beautiful stories that continue for several issues and that really focus on PETER ...I guess I am getting old!!! "
False,0,"Yeah, I totally agree. I really liked how they threw Sajani in though, it seems kind of funny having her in this."
False,0,"Its off to a great start, i see they are changing things and adding twitter and smart phones really helps id the era in which Peter lives. And Norman and Harry's hair style doesnt look like a black guy who just got waves ( yes im a black guy with waves, dont judge). "
False,1,Definitely recommend it! As everyone said it bodes greatly with the MCU. Marvel's goal is to have all of their movies & shows (on ABC & Netflix) connect in some way!
False,0,Ya it is cool
False,0,I recommend it. But it isn't necessarily a must watch. But when the Inhumans movie comes out. I think a lot of origin stories will be told through Agents of Shield
False,1,"My Recommendation, YES! Marvel's thing is EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED, so even in the smallest detail, somehow it's connected to the bigger picture "
False,0,"It's a great series, and it 100% connected to the movies. Before captain America winter soldier came out there was an episode of agents of shield where shield takes over, and when I watched the movie I knew that plot already. I was shocked "
False,0,It's great and goes along with the movie
False,1,"It's building up The Inhumans in a big way. Right now they're doing The Secret Warriors storyline and they have an annual crossover for whatever movie comes out at in may. They've been teasing Civil War. Now it's not a super hero show its a spy show with superhero elements so don't expect big CGI fest fights most of the times it's just hand to hand that might change a little because of the Secret Warriors forming. But if you like a show with great character interactions like in the movies, bad ass women, and great obscure characters that will never be in the movies watch it."
False,0,I recommended it
False,0,Agents of shield and Gotham are the only two superhero shows I can't get into
False,0,"I actually really recommend it. It does play well with movies (some more than others). The show has a pretty big budget too and with a good budget, comes a good show."
False,0,"Howard The Duck 



But actually Agent Venom"
False,0,I would prefer Iron Fist
False,0,I could see the Runaways as one
False,0,I could see that. Maybe a midnight sons 
False,0,I think Suicide Squad has a chance of making more money than both.
False,0,Borh
False,0,"People are more familiar with this epic duel of batman and superman. I would hope that civil gets more hype, but people who don't pay attention aren't going to know that spiderman will be in the movie. Everyone is focused on batman vs superman and Wonder Woman "
False,1,Civil War
False,2,"Civil War, everyone honestly knows who's going to win the fight between Bats and Supes."
False,0,Batman v Superman. I think a lot more people like Batman more than both Cap and Tony and Kal-El. 
False,1,But Spider-Man joining the MCU has way more buzz than Dawn of Justice 
False,0,"Dawn of justice of corse, everyone read in the comics the times that superman faced batman, but now to see it in the movies, is pure eye porn"
False,2,I think (and hope!) Cap 2 
False,3,"Civil War, off course"
False,0,I can't wait for the movie to be out
False,0,Pumped for this movie
False,1,"They should have made it a Captain America/Iron Man title, I feel they would focus so much more of Captain's side since its his movie."
False,0,Who isnt is lame 
False,0,Hyperion (Mark Milton)
False,0,I like classic the new guys are not than exciting to me 
False,0,Ms Marvel (Kamala Khan)
False,0,Inferno is new
False,0,I said NEW marvel character
False,0,Silver Surfer 
False,0,"Inferno, even though he can't fly."
False,1,Magneto
False,0,"Trust me. There is enough evidence to say 100% he's a mutant. 
1. He comes up on Cerebro
2. He's a mutant in the X-men days of future past comic
3. Richards has confirmed it multiple times
4. He says he is a mutant when he travels back to our time from the future in the Original sin Avengers comic (if I remember correctly)
"
False,0,Not the same thing
False,0,But they also said deadpool was a mutant a lot of times but he def wasn't. His whole deadpool carrer was a mutate.
False,0,"Franklin have an x-gen and it mention in a lot of comics: Fantastic Four, X-Men, Generation-X..."
False,0,Maybe he is 
False,0,But they said he was born with his powers and the celestials stated that he was beyond omega. I also dont remember sentinals attacking the Baxter Build for Franklin
False,0,"You also pretty much have to have the x-gene to be a mutant. If you are mutated without the gene, you're a [[Mutate]]."
False,0,"Secret Wars has made some stuff unknown at the moment and they could put him back to not being one, but in X-Men: The 198 Files #1, they said he's an Omega Level Mutant."
False,0,Teleporting is the best
False,0,"Super speed is awesome, it's pretty op. My favorite power is flying but you can fly with superspeed as well. So it's the best power "
False,0,Cant go wrong with the power of cheese
False,0,Cheese
False,0,Silver Surfer's power is my all time favorite
False,0,Love.....
False,2,Superspeed is good but the power to warp realty is awesome 
False,1,Superspeed
False,1,Spider sense
False,1,Healing Factor
False,0,"They never truly focus on thors power but I think Thor 3 is going to have a lot of work put into it, and they will execute him perfectly. I'm excited "
False,1,"It's not really that he's de-powered, just that they have trouble displaying his true strength.
"
False,1,But ragnarok is going to be good I hope 
False,0,@Theodoris Symidalas
False,0,Dudes know what exactly what I mean...^
False,0,Well....technically there is no thor 2 or 3. It-s Dark World and the  Ragnarok
False,0,"I think it's fair to say that Thor 1 and Thor 2 were good, but better than the other other movies...? Ehhhhhh "
False,0,How can they not be that good whwn it includes a god who is an avenger going on journeys across the galaxy 
False,1,"He's not de-powered, I just think the films simply aren't that good/not as good as the rest of marvel films. 
Also, if u think he's de-powered, Thor 3 is based off Ragnarok  and in Ragnarok in the comics, Thor get F***ed 
And Thanos will probably be in the film more than people think and rumor has it, he is going to fight Thor because Thor 3 is the last movie before Infinity war pt. 1, so they wanna show Thanos' might before tossing him in (basically his own movies). Just saying!
But, Thor is going to beat the Hulk in a fight in Thor 3 so that should show some power!
Sorry to get so into that! Lol 😅"
False,0,When was he de-powered  in the film?
False,0,Jessica Jones was pretty great consider Purple Man was portrayed by someone who fit the part so well. And Jessica Jones isn't a too far shot from 'The B- in Apt 23.'
False,0,Vision
False,0,Daredevil and Spidey
False,0,"Yea the ultimates 
"
False,0,I think right now I like The Ultimates the best!
False,0,Haven't read all of them except for Spidey
False,0,"A four way tie between spidey,all new x-men, black knight, and uncanny inhumans.
What's yours?"
False,0,"I wouldn't really want an Avenger team, lol. I'd want either an X-Men team or a villains team."
False,0,"Spider-man,ironman,ironfist,star brand and franklin Richard
"
False,0,"Spider-Man (Miles Morales), Captain America (Sam Wilson), Jessica Jones, Rocket Raccoon, The Thing, Invisible Woman, Marvel Girl, and Ant-Man"
False,0,Thats a pretty balanced team
False,1,"Captain America (Steve Rogers), Luke Cage, Thor (Jane Foster), Mr. Fantastic, Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), Doctor Strange "
False,0,"I don't feel like they're comparable. The art and storytelling styles are completely different. 

The new one is a mashup of alternate reality versions of the heroes you love. The old one is the heroes you love teaming up in ways you didn't expect."
False,0,I like the new one better. I felt the first one missed the mark with a lot of the characterizations. Also it felt much more rushed than the new one 
False,0,^ yes that too. DOOM IS A BOSS IN BOTH 💯
False,1,I love the original Secret Wars but I love the new too. Are different histories with a common name. Have the same principal villain...
False,0,The first had A LOT more action. The new one is a bit boring too. But I still love it!!!!!!! 
False,0,"Moon knight,Dead pool,Angent venom,Quick silver. Winter solder 

That's my team"

False,0,"My Gaurdians of the Galaxy team: Hulk, Mr. Fantastic, Black Bolt, Maria Hill, and Thor (Jane Foster)"
False,0,"Spiderman gets the job done, or even hulk (cho)"
False,1,Exactly comic relief every team needs comic relief 
False,1,"But what would howard really being to the team ,besides comic relief?"
False,1,"Im a big Howard fan! I have his first appearance in the comics, have his full Vol. 1, collect his series and is (yes I'm about to say this with a straight face) one of my favorite marvel characters for many reasons. 
But he simply cannot be put in a legitimate
 A-Class team because he can't keep up! "
False,0,Why not 
False,0,Friendship
False,0,He's kindness no matter he's looks
False,0,"Peace 
"
False,0,Love Groot!! I think the flower has some more power than just to put a smile on someone's face... I remember see something on the cartoon about his flowers... I'll look into it.. Thanks for responding.... Hope you're having a CHEEZY day
False,0,"He didn't have any money to give her so he gave her the only thing he could give her, a flower. Groot loves to help people like in the comics when Captain Marvel was sad and crying then Groot walked up to her and hugged her. Groot is a child at heart."
False,0,It's either just before Cap 3 or just after
False,0,Date?
False,0,Can't wait for it😁😁😁
False,0,Hell Yea 👍👍👍
False,1,Bring on the Punisher 
False,0,I am can't wait!!!
False,0,Dying for that to come out 
False,1,👍
False,0,Hugh Jackman himself wanted his successor to be Tom Hardy. I think he'd be a perfect fit.I loved Hugh as Wolverine as he ensured even mediocre films were elevated by his portrayal and amazing acting.
False,0,I think they should replace him with X-23.
False,0,Tom Hardy!

False,0,You can watch the avengers to see what loki did with the mind stone
False,0,You know what ... Let loki touch the powerstone and explode ... Done the end 
False,0,Yes but he already had one so why does he want another
False,0,The Reality Stone is way more powerful than The Mind Stone. Which is more effective controlling minds or bending reality to your will?
False,0,"The mind stone and reality stone have very different powers. Sure with the mind stone you can do a lot, but with the reality stone you can change not just how people think but how the the universe IS. Loki could make himself king of Asgard and he actually would be it, not just make people think it. "
False,0,He might be working with Thanos even though we don't really see it on screen. Loki is probably trying to help Thanos get all of the Infinity Gems to get something in return
False,0,What would he have done if he had the mind stone
False,1,"I think it's a great idea that would make a good movie, who gives a crap if he's black it would still make a good movie, and trust me that no offence stuff does not make your reply less offencive. I bet you white, black , Chinese and other cultures would like to see that movie."
False,0,"I think it's a good idea who freaking gives a crap if he's black, I would definitely see that movie.  And that no offence stuff doesn't make your reply any less  offencive  "
False,0,I say start off with an animated series first.
False,0,"Non comic readers would be both confused and upset when spidy turned balck (no offense) Spidey is such a all known and old character and people don't generally like change. I would not rule it out, nobody thought they would make a guardians movie and it was a hit. "
False,0,Not me
False,0,Its good. I think the way they'll do it if he's ever in a film is Spidy will die at the end of the third film of his new MCU trilogy and Myles will be there to take up the persona. 
False,0,I do and did any one see that short video of miles morales
False,1,Me
False,1,Me
False,2,"I know this will probably never happen, but I would like a multivers movie with him in it"
False,0,You could always ask the actual writers of the handbooks over at marvunapp.com...
False,2,"so you should like the post to get as many people as possible, especially Moon Knight fans, to like the page and make Marvel aware of the blatant glaring oversights of this character. A MCU film would be awesome if they include Moon Knight as it will be just the introduction he needs for further films. He can be a full champion for Marvel if they want him to be and market, cast and write well for him. As it is if they write for how Marvel has scored him currently he will be nothing more than some brain dead moron running around punching people. That is so not how even they have written him even from the very first comic. With a change to his ratings will see people more interested in him as for non fans he has no attributes attracting them. If you found he was rated accordingly then many would be more likely to seek out who he is."
False,1,"Those are some excellent points. While I do think he is widely poorly rated, there have been rumors for an MCU film. Think of Guardians of the Galaxy, I'm probably one of the only people to have already read the comics. "
False,0,But it would be awesome if they make one with Amadeus cho hulk he is totally awesome
False,0,You should make it at 2017
False,0,Their bringing Thunderbolt Ross back in Civil War so we might get a hint. And It would be a perfect place to introduce She-Hulk. 
False,0,It might not happen till phase 4 
False,0,I'd be so down for that. But then I would think hmmm what a waste of an opportunity to make the planet hulk film...
False,0,That would be a cool reveal. Probably a mystery film for phase 3
False,0,Ehh..not what I exactly wanted.
False,1,I know its awesome
False,0,Actually he would kill Barry but Cisco shot him with something like a gun. Then he left
False,0,"I got to lay My guess on Daddy Henry Allen. They got the same bodyshape, the area around the eyes are similar.

A friend and I guess that is why he doesen't Kill Barry the first time 😊 "
False,0,Wally West's (Flash) enemy. Zoom has the uniform of Eobard Thawne (Reverse-Flash). He's name is Hunter Zolomon from Earth-1. Atleast in the comics. In the series i have no idea who he is.
False,0,"*facepalm do you watch the flash? He's on it right now, it's a great show. "
False,0,He's a DC Flash Villain who is super fast. That's just about all I know about him
False,0,I'm pretty sure that is DC
False,0,"Also I think a S6 movie will most likely happen in response to DC's all villain movie ""Suicide Squad"" which is expected to make pretty good money."
False,0,Thanks and is would be awesome to see hulk verse The Lizard
False,1,Drew Goddard said there is still a possibility that they will do it after they establish the new Spider-Man. 
False,0,They cancelled the Sinister Six movie. 
False,1,"Yes. The main thing u basically need to know is that Sony and Marvel entertainment share Spider-Man equally. Spider will 100% be in the movie continuity and yes, to answer ur question, if Sony makes a S6 movie, it would be with The Avengers, GotG, Agents of SHIELD, Daredevil, ect. Spider-Man and everything that goes with Spider-Man (villains, people, and all related as well). 
* Also good to know is that in the deal between the 2 companies, Sony has the right, and will use this right, to include Marvel Characters like Iron-Man, Cap, Thor, Hulk, Daredevil, ect. to appear in his movie! 
Hope that answered ur question! "
False,0,"Well, they said it's going to be in 2016 and I don't think that they'll do another one in 2016.."
False,0,No
False,0,There's a rumor that it's going to debut next week
False,0,"Really hoping that Apocalypse looks like the classic apocalypse with the arm tendrils and stuff. The Apocalypse I saw, looked ehhhh..."
False,0,Me to
False,0,Im still waiting on the movie 
False,0,It's debuting in front of Star Wars. Marvel and Fox are collaborating together now.
False,0,X-Men Apocalypse you say?
False,0,"Same here buddy, and i'm happy marvel is coming out with deadpool. 

Leave any type of comment below. 

Ya ding dong."
False,0,"I'm excited hope they don't mess it up.
"
False,0,I hate deadpool I mean my least favorite anti hero is him I don't like Ryan Reynolds either so a perfect match for deadpool
False,0,"Who would win in a fight?

Logan vs Tony 

Who will win!?!?!?"
False,0,"Yeah marvel shouldn't come up with that, even though he's a mercenary he still has a little good in him, hey that's what i think.

As always leave a comment peeps. :D"
False,0,Yall should just hope that we dont have DEADPOOL KILLS MARVEL UNIVERSE movie 
False,0,"If marvel and Fox do get along, they need to finish the fight of hulk vs wolverine, and the incredible hulk because at the end of the incredible hulk, they showed tony and it seemed 2008 bruce learned how to control the hulk, well that's what i think. 

Leave a comment on this one as well, tell us what you think down below!  :D"
False,0,Me too. Now that Marvel and Fox seems to be getting along hopefully down the line we'll get a big universal crossover event. 
False,1,"Just give meh some replies, who knows maybe i'll even answer some of them in time, get it ""in time""? Hahahahaha of course you don't.   -sigh- 

Well yeah just give me some thoughts of what you think about the DEADPOOL movie and tell me, no no no i mean us what you think because we all need to spread the word like a helicopter. 

Ca-ching money time see ya later and thanks for having the time to read this.


Ya still reading you ding dong."
False,0,"I heard in phase 4 it will be an Iron Man 4
"
False,0,I'd like to see an X-Men and Avengers cross-over and maybe even a new Fantastic Four reboot considering the last one sucked majorly. The third spot should be a Hulk movie because I feel like Marvel could do a way better job now that the MCU has become bigger and more popular. 
False,0,I would love for the rights to come back to marvel and finally get the fantastic four we deserve 
False,0,"I think Ghost Rider might be a good Netflix show. The CGI needed to show the skull and flame, bike effects, ect. might be a bit over budget for a Netflix show though, so a Movie of the character might bring him more justice."
False,1,X-Men? I really hope it's X-Men.
False,0,"Robert Downey Jr has been pretty adamant that he doesn't want to continue with solo Iron Man films, so I feel it's very unlikely that Iron Man 4 will be one of the films.

I really want to see the long-discussed Hulk sequel, and while it's unlikely, I'd love to see Marvel take a crack at a Ghost Rider movie.





"
False,0,I hope it's a new hulk. It's been a while since he was in the spotlight. As for the other two I hope it's for super heros that haven't been in a movie like moon night.
False,0,If one of them was Iron-Man 4 that would be a bold move for Marvel
False,1,"I'm hoping for Namor, She-Hulk and The Thunderbolts."
False,0,Um no not realy
False,0,"Well, at least a little cameo would have been nice."
False,0,"Let the show live man. 
Was the series good the way it was?
It was great to have Luke in the series.
And Nurse ""Betty""(I forgot her name already) in it was a plus. 
Enjoy and hopefully Luke Cage's series drops sooner than later"
False,1,Because their planning The Defenders. Having Daredevil show up in there would take away from the experience when her and Luke meets up with him and Iron Fist. Claire told her to call him but she said she had to do it herself. Having Daredevil come in and help this early would make her look like a weak character. 
False,0,It's in current time mcu before civil war and after antman 
False,0,I think it's after the avengers age of Ultron but I could be wrong the best way to find out is look out for references to other super heros and villains and events
False,0,But I Want To Know Which Avengers Movie It Takes Place Is It In Phase 3 Or Phase 2 Or 1 Does It Takes Place After Ant Man
False,0,Well Jessica is in Hells Kitchen where Daredevil lives and she has to stop her enemy the Purple Man
False,1,"The setting of Jessica Jones is Hells Kitchen, New York. This is the same setting as Marvel's other Netflix series 'Daredevil'."
False,0,Sorry. The real name of the axe is Jarnbjorn
False,0,Maybe a sword or Jarborg the axe
False,0,Just watch thor tales of asgard
False,0,Nope it was a sword 
False,1,Mjolnir. 
False,0,Who would be the next antagonist ?
False,0,"Don't know for season 2. But she will appear on The Defenders (2017)
"
False,0,I wouldn't be heart broken if she did not come back for season 2
False,0,Me too 
False,0,"Eh, it was okay. The first half of the show was great, however, the second half faltered quite a bit and lost it's stepping. The subplots became way too convoluted and none of them really had any good conclusions. Purple Man, as a villain sucked, David Tennant was quite under utilized. However, the best part of the show was Mike Colter's 'Luke Cage'."
False,1,Honestly they shouldve started earlier with someone else 
False,1,The new avengers first came about after the event dissassembled where the avengers were essentially split up. The new avengers includes characters like cap and black panther. 
False,1,Gaming man is actually ant man (hank pym) 
False,0,The orginal were Iron man Thor Hulk Giant man and Wasp
False,0,I know the original for avengers but not new avengers
