False,0,Pretty much.
False,0,"Great article,  I enjoyed it alot good post."
False,0,"TrueRavenclaw616: That's just bandwagoning. Every EU hater knows that EU was the big convoluted mess full of bland characters and continuity errors, and they are all glad it is gone. And there are Vongs in it, what a mess, and they killed Chewie!"
False,1,"I wish it were canon, but I'd be willing to accept it being non canon if and only if new books, like the sword of the jedi trilogy, continued to be made, and I won't read or watch anything from the new canon until they are. I also find it annoying when people complain about the EU but can't find examples to back up their claims."
False,0,Episode 7 will conflict with some of the stories though if they keep it.
False,1,I consider the old EU canon
False,1,You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting.
False,2,I have my own cannon
False,1,"Well, everything has its pros and cons. At least I will save some money :p"
False,1,"Nothing to really do about it. Push forward. Plus, even in New books they are referring to some EU making some EU, canon? Let's not lose all hope just yet. "
False,1,"I don't mind making everything after ROTJ non-canonical. Everything else should just be considered what they are, stories within the Star Wars universe that may or may not be 100% accurate."
False,1,"I'm fine with it. I always thought of the entire EU as pretty much how Disney redefined it; a lot of it holds truth, but is no longer the official story. So it's all essentially well-informed fanfiction, and I'm fine with that. It allows us to choose what parts we believe are true to the history (cuz let's be honest, there are A LOT of plot holes between sources, so making it Legends really cleans that up) and reject the stuff we don't like as not having happened, at least until Disney covers it or a new EU source is made canon. Remember, Disney and Lucasfilm never said they'd stop recognizing EU material as canon, just that they're pretty much starting with a clean slate."
False,1,Maybe he is Lea and Han's son. JJ Abrams might have been inspired by EU. Maybe he's based off Darth Caedus. Trained by Luke then turned to the dark side. It might be Obi-Wan and Anakin all over again.
False,0,Bantha fodder.
False,0,Adam Driver 
False,0,Kylo is han and Lea long lost son. Rai is there daughter. JJ be pulling I am your brother.
False,0,Lol
False,1,Or JOHN CENA!!!
False,0,LEBRON JAMES
False,0,"Thanks again, I'll have to check that book out also."
False,0,And it is Canon. 👽👍🏻
False,0,"Outside of the Force Awakens Journey and Aftermath, A New Dawn is a great book. It captures the pure escence of the Empire and it is a great book for people interested in Star Wars Rebels..."
False,0,Sounds great. Thanks for the info.
False,0,"I'll be getting that too (I love Alan Dean Foster). In canon, I really like Lords of the Sith, Lost Stars, and Battlefront: Twilight Company. Also, at the end of March, a book by Claudia Gray (the author of Lost Stars) comes out and will serve as a tie-in to TFA. I'm greatly anticipating that."
False,0,Is there any new good books worth reading then?ill end up getting the Force Awakens book. There's usually different things and more details in the book.
False,0,"Yeah, I really liked Allston's books. Hopefully some new authors will be able to fill in his shoes."
False,0,It's a little slow going. I was hoping it would be like Betrayal or the other books of that series.
False,0,"Of the canon novels, Heir to the Jedi and Aftermath are my least favorite. HTTJ didn't really capture Luke's character, and the lack of villain made the plot a little thin imo. What do you think so far?"
False,0,"However, I really liked Rae Sloane, the flashbacks/PTSD moments, and the interlude segments. Also, Norra being retconned into Return of the Jedi gave me an excuse to rewatch the Battle of Endor. No complaints there!"
False,2,"I can't speak for others, but I disliked the majority of characters, I felt the plot was uninteresting, and I didn't care for the present-tense writing style. It's the first in a trilogy and just couldn't really stand on its own. I also know a large number of people disliked it because they thought it would tie into Episode VII, and it doesn't really do that."
False,0,"Agreed, Robot Chicken is to die for."
False,1,"Robot chicken, bonus material in star wars box set."
False,0,"New question! For any of the fights listed above, who do you think would win and why?"
False,1,Plagueis vs palpatine 
False,1,"Star killer  V.S the dark council from the old republic
"
False,1,Darth Bane V.S. Darth Malgus 
False,1,Grevious an Maul!
False,1,"Ezra vs Palpatine, with an obvious result - Ezra burnt to the ashes."
False,1,Emperor Vitiate and Darth Sidious
False,1,Darth Maul and Mace Windu
False,0,"I'm unaware of any literature, and only know a little about the old Republic side of things. I get  the impression on here that post Return of the jedi material is not particularly good"
False,0,"The Thrawn trilogy, Darth Maul: Shadow hunter, Vision of the future. "
False,0,"Lost Stars, A New Dawn, and Splinter of the Mind's Eye."
False,0,"Are you new to the EU? Because if so, I'd recommend the Thrawn trilogy as a starting place. I don't know anything about the new canon though."
False,1,The thrawn trilogy
False,1,All the old republic 
False,1,Darth Bane trilogy. Darth Plagueis. The rise and fall of Darth Krayt.
False,1,"Han Solo trilogy. Loving it! Survivor's Quest and Traitor are great, too."
False,0,"Species that don't grow hair tend to use analogs for braids, which tend to be fairly standardized by species. Ahsoka demonstrated this with the traditional Togrutan silka bead braid. "
False,0,"The braid signifies them as a Padawan. When they are ""knighted"" it is traditional for their master to remove the braid with a lightsaber. The braid is then a keepsake and reminder. Anakin gave his braid to Padmae after it was cut off."
False,0,"Well never mind lol I would think it grows out as they go through the training before trials and all that. Ashoka tano has like a braid, but its a bead necklace"

False,0,Here i am Sir! 
False,0,I don't think anyone's interested Jesse 
False,0,Come on
False,0,You can do it
False,0,I thought Aftermath was pretty awesome. 
False,1,"In the new canon, Lords of the Sith, Lost Stars, and Battlefront: Twilight Company are my favorite novels."
False,1,I heard star wars force unleashed is a good comic 
False,0,"^By ""tiers of canon"" I was referring to G-canon, T-canon, C-canon, etc., but your post is still true."
False,0,"Canon, non-canon, EU, non-canon in EU... There are many layers. For example, if there's a story about Ezra finding Superman, it is non-canon, because it features Rebels character. It can't be EU non-canon, because Ezra is official Dysnei canon. Do you understand, padawan?
For EU non-canon, Revan being female is the example."
False,1,The tiers of canon apply only to Legends (the official continuity before April 2014).
False,0,"Last time I checked there are actually different levels of canon, see canon article on this wiki."
False,0,Thanks! :D
False,2,"Canon is the official story of Star Wars. This includes the Episodes, The Clone Wars and Rebels TV shows, and any books/comics released after April 2014. Non-canon is anything that is not a part of Canon."
False,0,"The people that label the genres usually base their decision on past books by the author. Though Claudia Grey aimed it for Young Adults, it was more of a classic Star Wars story. So far it is my favorite canon novel. Definitely worth the read in my opinion"
False,0,"Still reading Battlefront, but I haven't had much time with finals coming up."
False,0,"@AV. . , better than Battlefront?"
False,1,My favorite new canon Star Wars novel. Don't let the YA label scare you away from it.
False,0,"And given that his character is CGI it supports the fact that he may be an alien race or Jar Jar, or maybe they're using CGI to make Mark Hamill fit."
False,0,Plagieus could use the force to become immortal. But after reviving a person (or himself) to much in a short amount of time it would stop working. His apprentice (the emperor killed him in his sleep during episode 1. But the question is did he really did?
False,0,Luke. Plagueis. New Character. 
False,0,Ty guys u are da best 
False,0,Basically the emporer of the first order.
False,0,Thought that's what his title was 
False,0,"Supreme leader snoke Will show up in the New movie, i think he is a kind of a sidious type without force powers"
False,0,I think. I could be horrendously wrong there  
False,0,He is the supreme leader of the new order 
False,0,Some people are saying that snoke is Darth plagues
False,0,"Also, I like the forum too. Kinda sick of the Person vs Person posts though"
False,0,"Because of where Darth Raven fits in the timeline, it is unlikely that he is DR, and since KOTOR is no longer canon, he doesn't exist. If their is a nod to him, it will be a behind the scenes nod"
False,0,"And BTW, I also appreciate the lack of ""junk"" on this forum."
False,0,I feel like it's a slight nod to the KOTOR but I think it's just to show his some sort of Vader enthusiast 
False,0,"For those of you with the ""Jar Jar is a sith"" theory, it kinda looks like a gungan head."
False,0,"Well, it's highly inspired by Revan, but it's a nod to Vader. They don't care about KOTOR fans."
False,0,Literally cried. 
False,0,I got so excited that I started to tear up just thinking about it. This movie is gonna be crazy

False,0,"The empire wasn't perceived as evil. They were portrayed as though they were making a difference in the galaxy. And personally, I don't think that the empire was evil, it was however led by evil and those who followed his orders did so with the belief they were good. "
False,0,"The empire seems evil from our perspective, but people in the STAR WARS universe don't necessarily see it that way."
False,1,"In Disney's Rebels TV series and Jason Fry's Servants of the Empire novellas, the Empire sets up a vast network of Imperial Academies including one on the Outer Rim world of Lothal. The Lothal Imperial Academy is a junior one-year academy that takes teenagers. There are also senior academies like the Arkanis Academy. There are also officer training academies run by the Imperial Army, Navy, and Stormtroopers. Most of the clones have died out. Most of the recruits are patriotic human boys and girls. It is unclear if the Empire is still xenophobic but Jason says that it is no longer misogynistic. "
False,1,"Some were conscription I think, especially form the outer rim and mid rim worlds."
False,2,"When Palpatine took over, it was slowly and legitimately. When the Empire was born, Palpatine was at the height of his popularity. The Clone Wars were over, the Galactic economy was on the rise, life was good for many citizens. It wasn't until a good decade after that people started realizing that the empire wasn't such a good idea. Even Han was trained as a pilot in the Imperial Navy. 
So aside from the various clones, the majority of people who were Stormtroopers by BBY were just very patriotic citizens. One of Leia's notes in ""The Imperial Handbook"" states that most members of the Scout regiment were actually in it for the adventure and had no idea what the info they gathered was being used for."
False,2,"Well, I would say that the type of people that would enlist would either be: people trying to make a little money for their family, really patriotic patrons, people that crave action and war, and people that were forced to join the Empire."
False,1,"Well, the Empire kept on producing clones, and this can be seen in the book Allegiance by Timothy Zahn (Great book). This took place in 0 ABY, and in it he says he hated when humans enlisted, and said he preferred using clones instead. No need to spoil it further. 

Anyways, majority of the enlistee's that joined the Empire were patriotic young adults from the core, reason for this was because the core worlds were where Imperial citizens had it good and didn't see the atrocity of the Empire. 

Vader's 501st consisted of the best stormtroopers (both clones and non clones throughout the Imperial Stormtrooper Corps). "
False,1,pretty much anyone. the only pure clones in the empire was the 501st which was basically vaders body guards
False,0,"Aftermath is a highly, first installment of a trilogy,  anticipated glorified fan fiction novel written by the great author no one's heard of, Chuck Windig. The best thing about the book, is that the cover would make a cool poster.

False,1,It is better than Truce at Burkia or whateverthehell the other after ROTJ is called
False,0,"A badly written book with all PC and GC standards of nowadays world, which you can simply ignore, as it is not important for seeing TFA. But if you like bad books, go on :-)"
False,0,Probably intentional
False,0,"Once in rewatching ROTJ during the ""major"" moment between L&L outside of the Ewok village, I wondered why Christiansen and Portman catch so much flack when that scene and other L&L scenes where as bad if not worse . . .

So, much like McGregor did an amazing job of ""playing Alex Guinness"", is there a chance Lucas wanted Hayden and Natalie to take from Hammel and Fisher dialogues as well?

Or am I just reaching and to lazy to look up the answer?"
False,0,"Bane brings up a good point, but I gotta agree with TK. The only reason Vader doesn't use force lightening is because he'll short out. However, Vader could block it with his lightsaber."
False,1,Count dodgy would electrocute him and his suit would stop working
False,1,Darth Vader's Djem So style only got better since his fight with dooku so Vader wins easily. Especially when you take into account that Vader incorporated makashi (dooku's form) into his own.
False,1,Yeah but it was Ankakin when he was a squirt and annoying. This is between 2 lords of the sith!

False,0,"No he brought balance to the force because in the end dark and light sides were gone. By the end of Return of the Jedi, there are no more trained Sith or truly trained Jedi. Luke isn't fully trained and he has both dark and light in him so he is balanced. "
False,0,Someone once said that he brought balance by experiencing both sides of the force and choosing the light in the end.
False,0,"I always saw the title ""Return of the Jedi"" as Anakin returning to being a Jedi at the end of the movie but so many people insisted on it being about Luke. On the face of it, yes (as otherwise you'd know how the movie ends!) but after watching the film, that was my interpretation of the title. 

Balance was restored by Anakin. "
False,0,But if it's about balance then there will always be a dark side which can't be good.
False,0,Preach!!!!! I 100% agree!!!
False,0,"Balance between the light and dark side, one is nothing with out the other and they are both needed to keep the universe running   "
False,0,But the Prophecy isn't about the Light triumphing. It's about balance. 
False,0,EXACTLY
False,1,"He didn't destroy the dark side, or free the light side into the universe. He brought balance to the force, all sides of it, Light, Dark and whatever the nightsisters used"

Third: Jar Jar Binks sucks but using the word ""gay"" as an insult also sucks."
False,0,I say Lucas is the one who is not a Star Wars fan at all
False,1,"The original trilogy wasn't really made by Lucas. In fact, he only directed A New Hope and had little involvement with Empire or Jedi. The only films Lucas made independently were the prequels."
False,2,A true fan is open to new ideas if it means a brighter future for the saga.

False,5,"If you know a lot of information about any area of Star Wars, be it comics, movie trivia, video games, you're a true fan "
False,1,"The true SW fan is a myth. Although I consider people who have a bigger overview of the universe (books, comics, games) as ""more true"" than just random ""true"" casuals, that only see movies."

False,3,Who needs George? HE'S the one who's not a true Star Wars fan. 
False,0,"But would Qui Gon be willing to kill his friends. I think a more rebellious jedi would start killing off the other jedi like Quinlan Vos, or even Anakin, or Pong Krell. But by the end of the day, I am pretty sure yoda would come out on top"

False,0,Sidious would be my bet. He'd most likely do one of his mass-destruction thingies. That's why the Jedi never sent hundreds of Jedi after one Sith: they'd just get blown up.

False,0,He is indeed one of the greatest especially for being the one who rediscovered The Force Ghost and he also trained Obi wan and Yoda(on how to use the Force Ghost) and a member of the high council he is certainly one of the best.

False,0,"They spent $200 million on it, they'd wanna hope it is good!"
False,1,"Mace would, but what we know about Luke might change by the end of this week and we could have another out look on the fight."
False,1,Mace! 
False,1,Luke uses the dark side of the force frequently (sith force choke)  so Mace Windus Vaapad would get pretty damn powerful. 
False,2,It depends on what time frame we are using of Luke and Mace both.
False,2,"I believe Mace would win. Although Luke has more potential as a Force-user, Mace has had more Force training and more combat experience."
False,1,Luke would get absolutely destroyed. 
False,1,I think that Luke skywalker would be able to defeat mace windu because maces vapad only work when it draws dark energy from people who use the darkside 
False,1,Mace with that Vaapad
False,1,"Mace, he's a master of form 7."

False,0,"Yup I wish they would have used Tatooine too, hope there's something great about that planet, a good reason to not use Tatooine"
False,2,Part of me wishes they would of stuck with existing planets.

False,0,Hi
False,0,Very possible that our Munn Friend cheated death. 
False,0,Plus Tarkin book references Darth Plagious book a lot.

False,0,Mesa not a Sith Lord!
False,0," Brucewhelan, It's been confirmed the Jar Jar is not in the movie."
False,0,S/o to T1D2 bc I was thinking the same thing. A lot of sith have been able to over come death but only darth plaguous could for life. But that would be a good ass eye opener for the fans!!!
False,0,In the trailer I swear I saw boba feet
False,0,They hinted a few times in aftermath. Dengar says that he sees him and they find a set of Mandalorian armor in one of the Tatooine scenes. I am guessing he lived and ditched the armor since he is easily recognized with it on. An armor-less Boba could walk through Jabba's palace and not be noticed. Easy to pick out that Beskar in a crowd.
False,1,"We don't know yet. In Aftermath it's hinted that Boba got out, and the trailer for Battlefront hinted at that as well, but we'll just have to wait and see."
False,0,"Chaissus has a point. Though only Dark Side users are more commonly known for force chocking, Vader the most famous. There isn't really anything about it that defies it as Dark or Light side, only what is in the users heart. 

Force lightning is definitely a sith thing though, I recall it was named Sith Lightning at some stage"
False,0,Never knew force choke was only limited to the dark side.
False,0,Very true!  Even though Luke Is a powerful force user and is for the good of things.  If he dabbled in the dark side of the force too much it's extremely possible it consumed him.  Anakin for example.  
False,1,"While I doubt the rumors about Luke going dark, that moment in ROTJ has always made me wonder."
False,0,No that was a theory but no.
False,0,I agree
False,0,"True, but the episodes in S2 still feel too short. While if they were more 2 part episodes, the stories could be bigger"
False,1,"I don't see the point really. The Clone Wars was an anthology-based series, so story arcs were mandatory, but Rebels is one giant continuation. Each episode builds off of the previous one."
False,0,It does sound like a video game and the force unleashed three was hinted at
False,0,Though 2 definitely was good. It did deliver short. And that whole dark side bonus thing at the end was just weird and that was the moment that really ruined it for me
False,0,"It is, but I loved the first one, and was absolutely heartbroken at how disappointing two was. "
False,0,It's a shame when a story is left untold
False,0,"Well now that u mention it, actually yeah"
False,0,I'm sure the story would allow a 3rd...but I don't thing the 2nd did well enough. 
False,0,"I agree that TFU2 lacked atmosphere, but it ended with Vader being captured like they had a 3rd one planned"
False,0,"Probably not, I thought 2 kind of sucked...."
False,1,yeah it really does 
False,0,"Sorry, I don't think it's possible."

False,1,Darth maul/Shaak Ti. 
False,2,Yoda
False,2,No I was taking about on the show. 
False,1,"Also, if you saw her in the live action movies on Geanosis, that was Shaak Ti, not Ahsoka"
False,3,"The Clone Wars TV series fills the gap between Episodes II and III. The reason she was on Geonosis is because a second battle was fought there following the events of Episode II, after Anakin received her as his Padawan. More info can be found at http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano."
False,0,"Dooku would win, maul doesn't even have force lightning rofl 😈"
False,1,Long fight. But doku would win at the end
False,1,Mauls overconfidence is his weekness. That's why Ob1 defeated him. Dooku could take him easily 
False,1,Dooku's age would also be a weakness in a duel. Maul would cut through that slow old man.
False,2,Count dooku is smarter and a master swordsman
False,1,Darth Maul. I belive he is more skilled in swordplay than Dooku
False,0,That would be one to watch !
False,1,I think it would be darth maul because I do not know Kylo rens information
False,1,It was originally gonna be in season 7 of The clone wars. The story reels on. YouTube 
False,1,*April 2014
False,1,Yes. Everything released after April 2015 that's not part of something legends is canon.
False,1,"^Blood Lines is Legends. This post is referring to the new canon short story ""The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku,"" which is a tie-in to Episode VII."
False,0,"Read the book""blood lines"" about Boba fett."
False,0,How the hell are they still alive?
False,0,"He has his own spin off film in a few years time, might appear at the end in slave 1 like a marvel credit scene, so it's possible "
False,0,I doubt it; it wouldn't be relevant to the plot and would just bog down the story. Perhaps he'll show up in Rogue One or the Han Solo film.
False,0,I wish but I don't think so since he would be pretty old and I personally would want my boba fett experience to end while he's still young and cool
False,0,That would be cool!!
False,0,I hope so
False,0,Only a few good legends exist and even fewer are true.
False,0,I love legends 
False,0,I hate Canon. it is a monstrosity.
False,1,It will change because the Canon stories are just starting out while there was some 40 odd years of legends.
False,0,"I think with legends, not everyone reads them and all that so you can't just have a movie on it without the audience being aware of what's happening/happened.."
False,0,"Looks good but seems kinda watered down compared to legends. But perhaps that will change with time...

False,0,Wat U says?
False,0,Hey 
False,0,"I think that Rey and Finn will be equal Jedi and kylo will be the apprentice to an even stronger Sith master, that way we will be able to see multiple Sith and not just 1"
False,0,When Rey announces herself as a jedi. I'm willing to bet that she will have a double lightsaber. So the staff she is carrying is simply training her how to weild a double lightsaber
False,0,"I do believe that Rey is the main Jedi, but Kylo will last long because of his power. He is resistant to the light side of the force"
False,0,Agreed. I kinda feel that Kylo might just be a fanatical guy obsessed with Vader bc snow was interested in Vader. I think a lot of back story on smoke will be revealed and Kylo with be one of those villains that is dangerous bc he is sociopathic and has the resources.
False,0,I think Kylo will grow in strength until he becomes a force to reckoned with. Rey Wii grow stronger also.
False,0,I'm a fan fiction writer. But Star wars is something I dare not touch because of the highest respect that I have for the ever growing franchise
False,0,Since Kylo has Vaders helmet what else could he have salvaged. Luke has Vaders lightsaber or Snoke could have it 
False,0,"@MadisHook Execpt that we've already seen Kylo unmasked and he's definitly not Luke.
----------
I think Kylo robbed Anakin's tomb."
False,0,Interesting.. Very interesting 
False,0,Maybe that will be revealed Dec.18
False,0,I've thought of that too. This only adds fuel to the Kylo Ren=Luke debate. 
False,2,It's Ian McDiarmid. he played him in episodes 1 and 2. 
False,0,I don't know his name. It's the same guy though. He had to use more makeup for Revenge of the Sith since he was older then.
False,0,I just watched that movie today!
False,0,"He is being played by Gollem actor, and the face of King Kong"
False,0,There is no Canon image of him.

False,1,Galen
False,1,"Galen , he has force fury."
False,0,Thanks!
False,0,"Ben Kenobi acknowledged R2 like their could have been history. But R2 didn't acknowledge back. That could either be because of a memory wipe, or the fact that Obi Wan had aged a lot.
Plus, R4 was Obi Wans droid, R2 was Anakins, maybe he spent little time with Obi wan during the prequels and clone wars. 

Maybe R2 did recognize Yoda, but without 3PO to translate, we never know what he said. 

And I don't recall the droids ever facing Vader. Face to face. So maybe Vader didn't know that they were the same droids, while the droids wouldn't have recognized Anakin"
False,0,They had a memory wipe. 
False,0,One idea is that he purged his memories of the Jedi (at least the visual data) thinking he wouldn't see them again and was unnecessary. Or maybe he does remember and we just don't see it.
False,0,R2 has been through far worse then getting shot by a TIE Fighter without any apparent memory loss.
False,1,"Yeah and when Ben kenobi found R2 on tattooine he didn't seem to recognise them, neither did Vader (Anakin)"
False,0,"Maybe when R2 was being fixed after the Battle of Yavin he lost some of his memory. I mean yes he has been shot a few times before, but not by a laser blast from a ship. It could have some more damage to his system"
False,4,Only C-3P0 got his memory erased. Any other in-universe suggestions?
False,1,Also at the end of the prequels r2 and cp0 got there data erased
False,2,Senator Organa wipes R2-D2 and C-3PO's memories at the end of ep.III Revenge of the Sith.
False,0,"Yoda: Much to learn,you still have "
False,0,"The force is the force, how you interpret it or whatever faction you choose won't alter what the force is. "
False,0,"Sith is just a name. There is no dark or light side. There is just the force. The dark side just means that you aren't afraid to explore for the sake of gaining power. As long as you are strong in the force, it doesn't matter. "
False,0,Not a Sith =/= Not powerful.
False,0,They thought the same thing about Vader. Luke still sensed good in him. Darkness cannot overcome the light 
False,0,Kylo is proved powerful because he can use the force and is immune to the light side of the force
False,0,"True, but the force could only help
"
False,0,General grievous wasn't a Sith and if you have seen Star Wars the clone wars tv serious and the third movie you will know that you don't have to be a Sith to be very powerful 
False,0,I wonder if he can use force lightning or does he also have a prosthetic arm or hand. That's what limited Vader to using a choke only.
False,0,And he still has the force I'm guessing 
False,0,"If Disney brings out another star wars show, it will probably be a serious one rather than a preschool aimed show. As far as I'm aware, if characters die in a cartoon, it can be for grown ups and that makes it a serious show. 
For the record, the LEGO ones are a joke in my opinion and have no canon legitimacy. 

I don't think another show by Filoni's team will come out while Rebels lives. Though another team may pop up and bring a new star wars show with a brand new design"
False,2,"Those shows were created by George Lucas. With the Disney acquisition, Lucas is only a consultant, so more shows like that are very unlikely. Disney = larger budget + greater resources - Lucas."
False,0,"If they did, the only way they could do it is no jar jar, unless he does in the first episode... sorry jar jar fans"
False,0,"Excuse my typos, guys!"
False,1,"Well, what the people above say, but in my opinion, Canon is a few movies and Legends is a Galaxy. Canon simply cannot compare."
False,0,"Ayrehead92 & Brandon Rhea: maybe I should rephrase. Legends can possibly be carried over as canon when confirmed, like when Sidious tells the Legend of Darth Plagueis. I should have said that aspects can be speculation"
False,0,Well as you can see this isn't such a noob question after all someone will aways know more than you so in a way where all noobs lol.
False,1,"AceLM92: ""it makes Revan and the KotOR still canon as well""

It's actually the opposite of that. Until something is specifically mentioned as being canon, it should be considered Legends. That's why novels and games are being re-released with a new ""Legends"" banner - everything (not from the films or the Clone Wars) pre-April 25, 2014 is Legends unless otherwise stated."
False,0,OK that's kinder cool I love the PT the way it is but I get where your coming from want anakin to show his true power and skill but how will order 66 coming to play
False,0,Sorry for typos.. Autocorrect isn't my friend.
False,0,"Honestly I wish they would just redo the prequels and change up the storey a little bit. The way Anakin turned to the dark side it's stupid and probably was the most disappointing part of them to me. I think the first movie should be wiped, star with Anakin being a bad ass Jedi who is reckless but efficient, much like the clone wars show.  The second movie he turns to the dark side by the end: not because of love because that's ridiculously stupid, but because he sees that he can become more powerful faster, which he wants to do because padme gets murdered (by the emperor but he frames the Jedi council.) and he wants revenge.  The third movie he it's Darth Vader and just goes on a Jedi killing spree. Boom. Not that hard and way more satisfying for fans. You're welcome."
False,0,OK thanks for clearing that out so what about the PT.
False,1,"DarthGirlPower: All of the new comics and books released since April 2014 are canon as well. 

Markus Pryde: No all of the Original Trilogy is canon including Episode V.

AceLM92: While the character Darth Bane is canon, the Darth Bane novels and the events they depict, as well as KOTOR and its events are entirely legends not canon. "
False,0,Man this whole thing is mixed up.
False,0,The force
False,0,Thanks
False,0,"Even though Luke and Leia didn't know it, they shared a Force bond since they're both twins and Skywalkers. Leia was as naturally strong in the Force, so Luke knew to call for Leia through the Force, though he didn't understand why for another year. And Leia sensed him though she didn't understand how."
False,1,I agree. Force telepathy is strong in those who posses an affinity to the Force
False,0,I think he was just calling for anyone and she just happened to sense him needing help
False,0,"And did he call her with the force, twin telepathy, or a mix of both?"
False,0,That's just cheesy 70s and 80s acting
False,0,Thanks
False,0,They may have sensors or some type of component that can feel or detect pain. Kind of like a peripheral nervous system found in sentient life-forms.

False,0,The Star Forge isn't a building. I don't think it's known where the largest buildings are (besides Coruscant). 
False,0,As well as I am informed the starforge is the biggest structure in the galaxy. If you want to look it up: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Forge
False,0,Well it is a mandalorian custom to pass armor from father to son etc
False,0,I believe boba took the helmet and made it his own
False,0,"It would be great to see bona come back in the new movies.
"
False,1,"The original helmet is probably gone, but it is Mandalorian tradition to take shards of ancestors' armor and imbed it into the ones own armor so perhaps Boba retained some pieces. "
False,0,"But the confusing thing is, when Boba used it in in the Clone Wars show, he put a bomb in it and when a someone touched it, it got obliterated."
False,0,"I believe the second is true. All I know is boba buried his father and kept the helmet and armor so
Im sure it's the same one "

False,0,"If it was released before April 2015, it's not canon. (Except for the films and the Clone Wars TV series)"
False,0,Nooooooo
False,1,"Nope. The Republic/Imperial Commando books are all Legends, although some of the characters have shown up in The Clone Wars TV show and are canon."
False,0,Though the wookipedia page regarding the battle of hoth puts it at 30 month after the battle of yavin and 6 months before that battle of endor... Definitely not much time for training
False,0,"I believe the accepted timeline is that there's 3 years between New Hope and Empire, and 1 year between Empire and Jedi"
False,0,"""Return of the jedi"" is not 3 years after ""Empire""? I think so, it took a lot of time to find where han solo was... I think that "" empire"" was 1 year after ""a new hope"" (sorry if there is any grammar mistake, english is not my first language)"
False,0,"He claims that he's a Jedi Knight, not a Master. He completed his training in the year between Empire and Return of the Jedi, becoming a knight with the construction of his lightsaber. "
False,0,"There's a deleted scene showing luke building his lightsaber in a cave on tattooine, so I would assume that he underwent his own physical training there as well as perhaps communing with obi-wan's ghost to learn more about the force in general"
False,0,"There's nearly a year set between Episodes V and VI, so it's likely that Luke learned more during that time."
False,2,A testimony to Star Wars original plots and character development 
False,2,"I loved this episode. I figured Ezra's parents had died, but I assumed that was prior to the events of season one. The reveal that they died after Ezra's broadcast was genuinely surprising (and heartbreaking)."
False,0,There were even rumors that said she originally died by Grievous hands and the one appearing in The force unleashed was Ahsoka but that wouldn't make any sense with Ahsoka in Rebels. Master Shaak's current status is unknown.  
False,0,"Wasn't she supposed to survive the assault on the Jedi temple and then go into hiding, but then get killed by marek years later?"
False,0,She also died in The Force Unleashed.
False,0,There are 2 delete scenes 
False,0,I dunno but for whatever reason I saw both IN ONE MOVIE 
False,0,"Both are deleted scenes. Originally she was planned to die aboard the Invisible Hand. Then that was changed to be in the Jedi Temple. Both scenes were ultimately cut, so here final fate is unknown."
False,1,"General Grivous and Anakin both kill her. 
Apparently, you only die twice."
False,1,"I've seen the deleted scene, I'm not sure about the other one?"
False,1,There is also this crazy thread theory about Snoke being Jar Jar Binks
False,0,Snoke is the supreme leader of the first order . It's also been theorized he is Darth Plagueis.
False,0,"In the clone wars someone says malachor like how one would say a swear word in real life. I think since the destruction of malachor 5 may be cannon Revan may also be, "
False,0,"Please no, Revan doesn't deserve to be ruined by Rebels. Especially that kid.
Reznov: Kanaan... Ezra... Chooper - these ""men"" must die!"
False,0,"It would be cool if Ezra starts seeing ghosts of Sith Lords on Rebels and then we can see Revan, Nihilus and more"
False,1,I really only care about legends at this point 
False,0,"Also, Revan was scheduled to make a Force ghost cameo in The Clone Wars, but the appearance was cut. I wouldn't be surprised if he were retconned back into canon at some point or another."
False,2,"The fact that Revan was part of Darth Bane's rise to power in Legends doesn't have any impact on Darth Bane in canon. Darth Bane was canonized by the appearance of his spirit in ""Sacrifice,"" the final completed episode of The Clone Wars."
False,1,New canon is bullshit. Legends is true Star Wars canon to the true fans 
False,1,The Bane that appeared in Clone wars was nothing like the Bane the of novels. I think the Sithari we all know and love isn't canon. Instead a ghost with the same name is.
False,1,"Right now, Raven isn't in the Canon, only because he hasn't been mentioned. It is possible he may come out in one of the Anthology films or future canon novels"
False,1,"The pre-trilogy also references the rule of two does it not? If so, it would lend credibility to the idea that Bane would NEED to be considered canon based on that alone.. Right?? "
False,1,"I would put my left arm in the line: there is no way that Luke is Kylo Ren!

I think we have a treat in wait on Wednesday. When Luke enters the screen he is going to have a badass entrance."
False,0,No 
False,0,It is SURE that he is not Luke. Like I said there are photos about kylo with no mask.
False,0,Haha same here
False,0,I hope he's not 
False,0,Yeah but there's so many posts supporting the argument of him being Kylo. Kinda saddening but I'm pretty sure nobody would like such a plot twist 
False,1,No. There are photos about Kylo without mask when they are doing the film so you can see that he is not Luke ^^
False,0,"I think Yoda regardless of age. 

I'm not particularly knowledgeable on the different forms of fighting but I think Anakin's arrogance cost him the fight against Obi-Wan. The only reason Obi-Wan lasted as long as he did (I believe) is that he trained Anakin so would know how to counter his moves. 

Obi-Wan tells Anakin that he could be as good a swordsman as Yoda (suggests that he see Yoda as better with a lightsaber).

He beat Grievance by shooting him rather than lightsaber battle although he held his own. "
False,1, since kenobi was able to defeat general grevious a infamous Jedi killer and pre darth Vader anakin skywalker one of the most powerful people in the Jedi council I believe that he would be able to defend against yodas attacks and counter with his own offensive stradegy 
False,1,I could see him learning to be wiser and more knowledgeable in the force but I wouldn't think he'd get stronger/more powerful in the last 20 years of his life. 
False,2,"Very True^ however, we haven't seen Yoda in combat since ROTS so perhaps hiding in Dagobah, a planet strong in the Force, has strengthened him. "
False,1,"Both of them in their prime? Yoda, no question.  However... Even in Revenge of the Sith Yoda is clearly showing his age against Darth Sideous, who btw describes Anakin as ""more powerful than both of us"" to Yoda, and Obi-Wan beats Anakin. I think before and even during the Clone Wars Yoda is definitely the favorite. However I believe his battle with the emperor weakened him to where it'd be a pretty even fight between Yoda and Obi-Wan"
False,1,Yoda I fact I was trying to think of a way Obi wan would win but can't.
False,1,Yoda would slice and dice him.
False,1,"Even though I love obi-wan, yoda would win"
False,1,Yoda

False,0,"I guess you could say he's a ""fan"" of the Sith."
False,0,"He's a Dark Jedi inspired by the Sith (Vader specifically), but not exactly a Sith himself in the traditional sense. At lease that's what I've read."
False,0,More of a pretender in my eyes
False,0,"It's pretty clear that he's a dark side user, but my guess on why they said he's not a Sith is because his training isn't complete yet. "
False,0,But heck if I kno. 😜
False,0,I think he's frum the knights of ren which I think are a bunch of dark-sidey-ish  guys. 
False,1,Maybe hes Force confused?
False,1,"It's been explicitly stated that he isn't a Sith, but there's nothing to suggest he's a Jedi either. He instead seems to be part of a faction separate from both called the Knights of Ren, although he might be the only force-sensitive member. "
False,0,"I am willing to give the new Canon a chance. The legends timeline had some good stuff to be sure. But not all of it was good and it sometimes tended to contradict itself or rehash the same things. I'm hoping that the new Canon can change things up a bit. Maybe show that the ""light side"" isn't always ""good"" and the ""dark side"" isn't always ""evil"""
False,2,"I'm sure we will. Just looking at The Force Awakens, 
I'm willing to bet characters like Kylo and Phasma will be just as iconic/popular among fans.

And to the above post, true Star Wars fans should be critical of the franchise, but give credit where due. With that said, the new canon's got my support."
False,0,New canon is bullshit. Legends is true Star Wars canon to real fans

False,1,"Hi Force User 7899, question, that sounds awesome, can I find those shorts on YouTube, Google, or? Is there a specific place I should go to, thank you in advance!"
False,1,Would be awesome.
False,1,I think it would be cool. We would get many new sith and jedi that weren't so known before
False,1,The rumored Netflix original star wars series could be around the old Republic era. Either that or the anthology films. They have to acknowledge the era further with Darth Bane in the Canon
False,3,I agree there mini shorts are amazing
False,0,"I'm sure there are connections, but I don't like thinking about it (I want to be 100% surprised when I see the movie). Less than 10 days away!"
False,0,Boba Fett should appear in Han's stands alone film in my opinion. They have a history of being frienemies. 
False,0,How will Han get a movie tho? I'm like so confused! Would H. ford play him still? Because he's getting old and I kinda would rather see a prequel which won't happen.
False,0,"I agree, I was just wondering whether the bounty hunter movie will be set during the empire or after these new movies"

False,0,"Because as we all know well Disney has never made anything even remotely enjoyable! Come on folks. Besides, Disney's barely involved in the Show's production. Hell, half the people working on it created ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars""."

False,1,It was a really good episode 
False,0,Oh yay. More Rebels. What joy. 
False,1,Hopefully Star Wars rebels comes up with some along the lines of Game of Thrones' R+L=J theory to explain Ezra's family origins.

X1 went on to make one of the many splinter factions of the Empire after the Battle of Endor, and became a Sith Lord.

He later killed his brother on Mustafar when he attempted to make a clone army of Skywalker.

These are now, however Legends. The game's plot was quite nice, really, even if the gameplay was terrible. Once again I find myself blaming Disney for this."
False,0,I think it would be a pretty good idea.
False,0,Well we have a storm trooper becoming a Jedi in the force awakens. So maybe
False,0,I don't think that concept will come into play in the New canon
False,0,Uh. No. 
False,0,"Well, it was already a video game. It was okay. "
False,0,Leia was definitely a trained Jedi Knight in the EU. 
False,0,I don't no I don't really pay attention to EU plz don't hate
False,0,"She does not train in the ways of the jedi, but is still force sensitive. In TFA she is a general and no longer the princess of a planet that exploded a long time ago. "
False,0,In the EU she becomes almost as powerful as Luke.
False,0,I hope so.
False,0,"Technically, the EU was canon. Go read Wookieepedia if you don't know that :-)
But who the hell cares about canon and non-canon, canon is what you like!"
False,0,"The Solo kids, I assume you're speaking of Jacen/DarthCadeius & Jaina? Yeah that's been pushed aside to 'Legends' (non-canon), And, even though the film makers, producers, etc. do their very best to keep everything strictly confidential, except obviously what we see from the trailers/teasers, & toys, in those which they've allowed us to see, there's nothing in them at all whatsoever pertaining to the original Solo family or any legends stuff. Basically after the sale, of Lucasfilm Ltd. from George to Disney, first they pushed whatever they wanted over to (Ledends) , & hired writers, & screen-writers to pen entirely new scripts, to continue from after Return of Jedi, moving forward. And also all of the stuff that is now ""filling in the blanks"" so to speak...for ex. the time periods after the events of Epusode III, in bet that & ep IV, etc. and then actually, I just realized myself while typing this, the fact that Clone wars series is Canon, that was actually started off by Lucas, that might be the only extra Lucas material they've kept, yeah so Series:Clone Wars seasons 1-6, and lastly in regards to me speaking of ""filling in blanks"", I guess what's left is.. SW Rebels.& the newer novels and comics/graphic novels. "
False,1,"Disney has utterly ruined my Star Wars world, even if it is still up to me what to believe and what not to believe."
False,0,He made Star Wars. His right only dissipated when he sold to Disney. 
False,2,Lucas has yet to earn the right to claim Star Wars. He made a few movies. The EU made a galaxy. 
False,0,"The solo twins are a concept from the EU.  The EU is no longer canon, and technically, never was. In the eyes of Lucas, only his movies were canon, which is something few people seem to understand. I have nothing against the EU, I enjoyed the Empire comics and the Legacy comics. And still think of many of those stories as worth being official canon."

False,0,From what has been released they don't. 
False,0,"Damn!! Did I see someone noted that there's approximately 400 million planets that have life?,I the SW Galaxy/galaxies??!! Sheesh! Where do I find that? Can I look on one of these apps or could I find that sort of info in the many books out in B & N for instance?"
False,0,Not exactly. Similar. You can even say Chewbaka is a kind of dog. All of the creatures made by LucesArts  comes from a animal in our world.
False,0,Probably 
False,0,http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dog/Legends
False,0,"There is quite a bit of references to dogs in the EU, so you could say that yes there are dogs in Star Wars."
False,0,"There are over 400 million inhabited planets in the galaxy, and many more that support life. Yes, I think it's safe to say, there are dogs. Not even counting the countless canoid species. "
False,2,"I believe the EU did have some straight up dogs. I don't know if NuCanon has used them yet, but like Rex said, with the fact that Marrok exists (Embo's pet) it's possible that other dog like mammals exist, including things very similar to dogs, if not outright dogs. "
False,0,"Embo has a pet dog wolf thing. Plus there is the Wolf Pack, so I'd imagine there are some wolves and dogs in the universe.... somewhere"
False,0,"Several kinds of dog-like creatures. Massifs, Kath Hounds, Anoobas, Akk Dogs...the list probably goes on."
False,1,"Here you go:

Canon: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_canon_media

Legends: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Legends_media"
False,0,I cried 😢
False,1,"A sad episode to be sure, but I'm hoping this will drive Ezra back towards the light, as he definitely displayed some dark side tendencies prior to and during the Empire's assault on Garel City. A good ending to the first act of Rebels' second season."
False,0,HAHAHA. I could list things all day and you still wouldn't have a complete timeline. 
False,0,"The movies? In terms of when each event happened, it goes in the episodic order. So: Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. The Force Awakens happens 30 years after ROTJ."
False,0,Copy cat 🐱.... Just kidding👍🏻
False,0,"^I like that explanation for my personal canon-records lol. Losing so much good canon because of Disney. Hopefully this is an opportunity to create some even BETTER, more consistent canon for this wonderful universe. "
False,1,"Not entirely true. In addition to the Jango clones, the Empire commissioned clone batches from countless other templates, both from Kamino and other sources. By the Battle of Yavin, one third of the Stormtrooper Corps was a clone of some sort. "
False,0,"The Stormtroopers were not clones. In the very early days of the Empire, the clone troopers served as the first generation of Imperial Stormtroopers, but were eventually phased out. By the time of A New Hope, the Stormtrooper Corps are made up of human enlists, not clones of Jango Fett.

Also, it's the First Order, not the New Order. :~)"
False,3,"In response to your question, the clone troopers are eventually phased out by normal human recruits who are trained at various Imperial Academies throughout the galaxy. Disney's Star Wars Rebels series and John Fry's Servants of the Empire novella series deals with that topic. After the Empire was created, the clone troopers were renamed Stormtroopers and the Jango Fett clones grew old and were replaced. Btw, the First Order is not directly descended from the Empire but is an organization that admired the Empire. Think of them as neo-Nazis."
False,1,"I feel that Finn could be killed off near to the end of the film or at the start of EP VIII, just to give the whole new trilogy a new spin on things, at the moment TFA just seems to be like a reimagined and more up to date version of a new hope...."
False,1,"An AWOL Stormtrooper with fencing lessons under his belt isn't a terrible premise. It's like trying to be a Jedi without the use of the Force, putting you at a disadvantage forcing you to be smarter than your foe in several ways. Alternatively, Boyega might be a decoy protagonist who gets killed in the end. Liam Neeson took up a sizable chunk of the TPM poster, after all. Of course you can argue his legacy had a big affect on the remaining prequels, but with that said, he was still killed off before the prequel story even began. "
False,0,All that we know is that Mark Hamill will be acting as Luke Skywalker in the film. Have to wait and see what happens to John Boyega and Daisy Ridley.
False,0,No.  It would be an interesting twist tho
False,0,"Because of what Luke stood for. I believe it is more likely that Kylo Ren is a clone of Anakin, than Luke turned evil. I mean just look at the shot in the trailer with Kylos hair?  Looks a little like III Anakin. "
False,1,"In my opinion, Kylo has no affiliation with Luke. I think that Luke will be acting sort of how Obi-wan did in A New Hope. I think a major plot point in TFA will be Han Solo helping the two new characters find Luke to be trained in the ways of the force. More evidence that Luke is NOT Kylo is because of how his lightsaber looks. From what we've seen, the beam of the lightsaber isn't very solid and it appears to be made by someone who hasn't had any training in making a lightsaber. This piece of evidence is a little less solid but I think it's valid for speculation.
"
False,0,"Kylo is not Luke as they are different actors ;) but yes, it would have been sweet. Mark Hamill is Luke while Adam Driver is Kylo"
False,0,I hope that Kylo is Luke.
False,0,Yes I think Kylo is his apprentice personally 
False,0,"How old would Yoda have been when he was a padawan? He says he is 800 years old in ep.V.

If Wookies live to be 400 years then Yoda would of been 300 something years old if Wookies remembered him as a padawan.

Ironic since Yoda claimed Luke was too old to train right?

"
False,0,Bowdaar was also few centuries old in SWTOR
False,0,The EU is no longer canon
False,0,"The problem with Chewbacca appearing it episode 7 is that in the EU he has died several years BEFORE hand. If this is Chewbacca from episode 4,5,6 and 3 (yes he makes a appearance in Episode 3 ) then that would mean this film does NOT tie in with Star Wars EU. I personally don't think that works with the Star Wars storyline."
False,0,"You could just check the Wookie article. Note the name WOOKIEpediea. But several hundred years is about right. Chewy was about 200 in the OT. Before the fall of Kashyyyk, there were some living Wookies that remembered as far back as when Yoda was a Padawan. "
False,0,This is the wiki look it up 
False,1,400 years
False,0,They typically live for centuries.
False,0,"Real reason for the green color is lighting/filming issues. They had a hard time capturing that piercing blue color against the sky when Jabba is sentencing Luke, Han, and Chewie. Canon-wise, it's what everyone said above. "
False,1,Star Wars Episode 6 Return Of The Jedi.
False,1,"In Legends, Luke constructs his lightsaber in Shadows of the Empire, a multimedia series that bridges ESB and ROTJ. In Canon, we don't yet know the story. However, in Heir to the Jedi, a canon novel released early this year, Luke is given a lightsaber and disassembles it to see its workings; also, in a recent issue of the Star Wars comic, Luke and co. discover a loot of lightsabers. These points may be expanded upon in the future."
False,1,There was a deleted scene for ROTJ that shows how Luke got his green light saber
False,1,Why is Luke's saber green?
False,2,The reason why lukes lightsabor was green because it was a gift from yoda. But obviously its not yodas because in revenge of the sith when yoda duelled with chancellor palpatine his lightsaber was like half his size lol
False,1,Thanks very much ;)
False,1,"Cwendin, at what point did Luke assemble his lightsaber? Or was it a gift from Yoda?"
False,2,"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi
Fun Fact: Luke's green lightsaber was intended to be blue, but the color was changed during production."
False,1,Return of the jedi. Luke Skywalker uses a green lightsaber.
False,0,Clones
False,1,"It's not really as simple as that. While clone troopers and first-generation Stormtroopers all came from the same genetic stock, later generations of Stormtroopers were recruited humans from across the galaxy who trained in a variety of Imperial Academies, allowing for too many variables to really make a fare judgement. However, it is fairly obvious that not all Stormtroopers are created equal, so I personally believe that the Fett clones are overall the superior soldier."
False,1,Phase two clone also it depends on the storm trooper some are more skilled than other and same with the phase two clone
False,1,Certainly a phase 2 clone trooper. Rex comes back in Rebels Season Two and trounces several Stormtroopers in the recent episode Stealth Strike.
False,1,"I wasn't sure how new content was going to be handled, and frankly I haven't looked. But this is good to hear, Brandon. You guys are doing pretty damn good. "
False,1,A decision I personally agree with.
False,1,"The site couldn't be locked down completely otherwise the bot would not have been able to edit. So accounts with bot, admin, and staff rights are able to edit still. Admin is so Cade can make maintenance edits, and staff is so I can continue to keep the latest release's pages as up to date as possible. We don't want outdated information during this change."
False,0,"I see. Thanks for clarifying.

False,0,phase I helmet but phase II armor
False,0,Yeah phase 2 
False,0,2 because it more sharp and cut
False,0,Phase 1 is the only Clone armour. The other is just a mix between Stormtrooper and Clone Trooper
False,0,Phase 1
False,0,Phase 2 ftw
False,1,"Tha snow troopers from the original Star Wars was pretty cool
"
False,0,Any particular one eg scout trooper or just the basic version? 
False,0,2 because it's a much more sleek design
False,0,Also that was in the prequel
False,0,I wonder the interaction between the 2 were deleted in the movie. I remember watching it in the theater and hearing how disappointed they were when the scene was never shown.
False,0,"Because he had no connection to Luke, whereas, both Ben Kenobi and Yoda both knew Luke before their deaths."
False,0,Maybe Kylo Ren hold the sacred position of The Mandalore? Hence the reason for their militant-like behavior? 
False,0,Doesn't Finn have Anakin's Lightsaber now?
False,0,Daaahlen is wrong on kylo fighting for the lightsaber because in episode 5 Luke drops anakin's/vader's lightsaber during his battle against Vader. Luke makes his own lightsaber. 
False,0,"It is said that he wears an ancient Mandalore helmet. This has no fact in it, and the idea comes from Darth Raven and how it looks like it. But Darth Raven not being canon, it's not Mandalore"
False,0,Or he is luke!!!
False,0,"kylo ren is a human from the knights of ren and is obsessed with collectibg darth vader artifacts (thus darth vaders burnt helmet in the trailer) which leads me to believe he might face off luke for his lightsaber (because it was originally anakin/vaders), although some people think luke has turned to the dark side, so ren might have turned luke to the dark side whilst trying to get his lightsaber"
False,0,"There is part of an article about that on this wiki. I believe it's under either ""Darth Vader"" or ""Sebastian Shaw"""
False,0,I thought to show him as anakin before he went to the dark side and became Darth
False,0,"""After he returned to the light?"" He returned to the light when he betrayed Palpatine and saved Luke. I think his Force Ghost should have absolutely been at his age as of RotJ, his redeemed form dying in Luke's arms."
False,0,"Because they show Anakin as a Jedi not as Vader, After he returned to the light and to Luke's father Anakin. It just to show his father as good. "
False,1,"It's to fit in with the continuity established in the first three films. To have Anakin look more like we saw him in the first three is great, but I much prefer the original cut myself. The unmasking scene also doesn't match when young Anakin is put into the 'ghost' shots. You might as well add Ewan MacGregor rather than Alec Guinness in that case.  "
False,0,The worst Star Wars book ever. 'Nuff said.
False,0,"Isn't Lost Stars a kids (er, young adult) book?"
False,0,"Regardless, it's way better than the last book based right after ROTJ, Truce at Baru-whatever.  I couldn't even get through the description of that it was so awful. . . That book goes in the win column for Canon "
False,0,I thought it was written so badly that I couldn't finish it. Lost Stars was far better
False,1,^Twilight Company was fantastic.
False,0,"Not bad, not great. . . Agree on the characters not being likable (with the exception of the droid and the drathomirian chick) , in general it's way to ""PC"" for my preference.  Although I may like it more after the movie and other books come out.

I thought Battleftont was far better "
False,0,"I was a bit disappointed by it. I didn't care much for the characters, plot, or writing style. Nonetheless, I loved Rae Sloane, the PTSD moments, and the interlude segments. Hopefully the next two novels improve my feelings for it."
False,0,I read Imperial Commando: 501st. It was decent not too exciting.
False,0,I read Hard Contact. It was okay. 
False,1,What's the name of that one droid who like exactly like C3PO but is a bounty hunter.. I'd say C3PO if he can get his hands on some weaponry first :D 
False,1,R2. Did you see how he killed Goldy? 
False,1,r2 gonna shock that butthole c-3po 😂
False,1,R 2
False,1,artoo by a long shot

False,2,Watch the Star Wars Youtube videos by Auralnauts. He edited C-3PO into a murdering sociopath. It's pretty great.

False,0,"They will remake it, once. That's what Hollywood does."
False,0,OLD REPUBLIC!!!!!! 
False,0,I feel like there is so much they could do with the old republic and it will also allow us to see so much more about the sith 
False,0,It should go to the old republic
False,2,Could go to the old republic 
False,0,"Agreed. Star Wars is looking to the future to tell new stories, not remaking (or re-litigating) the past."
False,3,Nope. In a universe as vast as Star Wars there's essentially infinite stories to be told. No point in dwelling.
False,0,"*finn but finn is a former storm trooper, so he has general knowledge about fighting, guns, war, etc. but i feel like luke might train him"
False,0,Probably luke but if not him some other new jedi with in the new jedi order
False,0,I've held Anakins style lightsabre. Most uncomfortable thing ever. The Qui Gon or Ep1 Obi felt good
False,0,"qui gons, my favorite was obi wans"
False,0,"Qui Gon Jinns, I thought his looked rather bland and boring, I didn't think Anakins was that bad really."
False,2,"Kit Fisto's lightsaber was pretty lame. Looked like a legitimate flashlight that they just handed to the actor and said ""Just turn the light on and swing it around like a sword. Yah, that works. Huh? No, it's not flashy. You're just in the background anyways. Shut up or your fired. No, only Sam gets the purple lightsaber."" "

False,0,"I believe that every part in the star wars saga has great stories, and some not so great. But what really defines them is how they look. As far as looks go, Ep1 was great, Ep2 and 3 were what lost it for me. Too much greenscreen"
False,0,"Clone wars because clones way
 Better than stormtroopers"
False,0,"They're both pretty good. The Clone Wars might have been shaky at first, but a lot of those Republic comics got real nitty-gritty and built the whole war pretty well. Rebellion era, of course, will always be the golden classic. "
False,0,Old republic 
False,0,"Clone wars just because of the variety it offered, more Jedi and more villains plus clones look a lot cooler than storm troopers and can actually hit a target."
False,0,Clone wars I like the variety of enemies from the droids and type of other enemies they verse it's cool 
False,0,Clone wars. I love a wide range of characters and they looked so much cooler and newer than the galactic empire era
False,1,Rebellion: characters are too good
False,1,Rebellion because of the AWESOME charchters
False,1,Clone wars: because plo koon is in it and clones look better than stormtroopers
False,0,Yeah.
False,0,"This is a prime case of you only have two hours and change to make a movie and a few minutes to end a Trilogy, and it's 1983

There is little to no possible way that a 20something with minimal training, and next no lightsaber training, could take down one of the most power Siths ever who's defeated and mauled through who knows how many Jedi,  by only  yelling and taking long horizontal swings at him 

Therefore, we are left thinking:

-if Vader threw the dual as he was already coming back
-if the suit was failing already
-if Palpatine was influencing it

Etc etc "
False,0,"I don't think so. When Vader starts talking about Leia, he was clearly trying to upset Luke. And if he was holding back at all, it was probably to lure Luke to the dark side."
False,0,I tried to do it in the jar jar binks theory
False,0,Oops wrong XD
False,0,"It is possible he's a sith lord, but i think the star wars fans are going too far. .."
False,0,I'm a believer haha. It helps me sleep at night when I realize how much the prequels really grind my gears lol. 
False,0,"The Darth Jar Jar theory is a great theory full of interesting ideas and possibilities. But it is just a theory, nothing more than that"
False,2,Whatchutalkinbout? Robot Chicken should be canon. 
False,0,"^Totally agree. Fun Fact: in a recent book series re-imagining the prequels to be Shakespearean, Jar Jar is in fact a mastermind pretending to be a fool. Also, Robot Chicken did the ""Jar Jar is a Sith"" thing long ago. Either way, both are strictly non-canon (hallelujah)."
False,1,"No, for a few reasons. First, it is canon that Jar Jar spent all but his childhood in Gunga city. There, it would have been impossible for him to learn the ways of the Force, much less be a Sith Lord and orchestrate the fall of the Republic with Sidious as a puppet. 
Second, regarding the theory's claim that Jar Jar's acrobatics can only be done by Force-Sensitives: Jar Jar is one of the most uncoordinated, clumsy Gungans out there. Rather than believe that he's a secret Sith because he can do some acrobatics, it's much more reasonable to think ""Gungans must have a natural agility in order to survive underwater"". 
Last, even IF George made Jar Jar the evil Sith Lord behind everything in a fit of his known weirdness, his ideas for the story of the new movies were largely scrapped. With J.J. Abrams being an outspoken critic of Jar Jar, it's very unlikely that we'll ever see him again."
False,0,Saber* not saved. 
False,0,"Well Maul with Cyborg legs or before Obi chopped him down? In both their physical prime, accounting for saved skills only, I'd call it a really really close match. Add in force powers and I'd say Anakin/Vader for sure. "
False,0,"SPOILERS!!! In the EU Darth Maul and Darth Vader did fight each other, with Darth Vader killing Darth Maul. So the answer to your question is that Darth Vader would (and did) win."
False,1,Darth Maul would win and he didn't say which form Vader was in nor what time period for Darth Maul
False,0,Vader cause he very strong in the force as well as physical strong while maul is very Much more physical
False,1,"Maul held his own against sidious for a brief time, so I won't say Vader wins easily. I will say,  if Maul can keep Vader from using the force, it'll be a closer fight than a lot of people think."
False,0,Vader would easily win

False,0,"Good theory! But like Cade said, until something is confirmed in an official source, we don't add information to pages."
False,0,"No, because that's either speculation or fanon. The truth will be explained in the movie."
False,1,"I will watch Episode 7. I might even like it. But to me, the ""Legends"" will always be the true canon."
False,0,"I was never a huge fan of the heavily and untastefully drawn out post-RotJ EU although the rest of the EU I LOVE, especially the old republic era. If they made a movie based on kotor or the great hyperspace war I would totally freak lol"
False,0,"Unfortunately, I am one of the people who can't believe in both."
False,1,"As Lucasfilm themselves have stated, ""Legends"" sometimes hold some truth. And indeed, some good things from ""Legends"" are re-entering Canon, mostly via Star Wars Rebels and its tie-in media (novels, comics, etc.).

So yes, considering Legends as quasi-Canon is indeed not wrong, and a good source for speculating into New Canon. In fact, it's a very fun game to guess which Legends elements will get ""recanonized"" next :-)"
False,1,I think the Original Eu will eventually fade away i will still read and love it but will not argue about which is better. There is nothing wrong with going in a new direction since someone else took over the franchise. Look at what happened in the star trek universe....a new direction and it's still awesome.
False,0,"Here's something canon that clearly contradicts from the EU: the First Order, Finn, Rey, Kylo Ren, and everyone and everything else that exists and happens following Return of the Jedi."
False,0,Same here

False,0,"Bane is also canon because of clone wars S6. 
Darth Raven is not canon"

False,0,"It doesn't matter what Disney calls canon, just play them the are really good games with intriguing  plot lines and plot twists. "
False,1,"Even though its noncanon, kotor and the old republic era in general could be called a grey area until material is brought forth to replace it. Some legends prove truer than others, and some may influence or even directly be part of future projects. Just my opinion though."

False,1,"We must learn to look to the future, no stay in the past."
False,1,"Of course we're changing canon to the default. It's the official story of Star Wars. If the Legends Chewbacca page was default, for example, then people searching for information about Chewbacca after they see Episode VII are going to see that he died, which is canonically false. It's to the benefit of the site's readers and Star Wars fans in generals to make this change, rather than stick to a Legends-default system that's for the benefit of only a few hardcore Legends fans."

False,1,"Whether Darth Plagueis did that experiment in canon remains to be seen, since the ""Darth Plagueis"" novel is Legends. However, the rest of what was said was accurate - as Qui-Gon theorized, Anakin was conceived by the will of the Force to be the Chosen One."
False,0,Darth Plaguies did an experiment on midichlorians and tried to control them. So the midichlorians conceive Anakin to bring balance to the force.
False,1,He was conceived of mediclorens or however it's spelled
False,0,He doesnt have a father
False,1,"I wish Disney hadn't destroyed the EU. Considering it sounds like they're having Solo-Skywalker children anyway, how hard would it have been to keep the continuity. It might not have been perfect, but Star Wars has been contradicting itself forever. Why stop now?"
False,1,"It doesn't matter what's canon to them. What you think is canon can be, in your own mind, canon."
False,0,"Star Wars has always been a money-maker. If people think that Lucasfilm was making all of those pre-Disney stories purely out of the goodness of their hearts and had no profit motive in mind, then those people are wrong."
False,0,Rant over. 
False,1,"I miss the EU. I don't see Star Wars as something mildly entertaining to read and watch on occasion. I see it as what it is, an enormous, fully constructed universe, that you can just lose yourself in. It has so much depth and character. Every background character has a name and story. Every starship and weapon has a story. EVERY KRIFFING FOOD SOMEONE EATS HAS INFORMATION ABOUT IT. But that's all changed. Disney's extended the reach of the megacorps outside of the Star Wars galaxy into our own. And now all Star Wars is is another way for them to line their coffers. "
False,0,You and I must be pretty similar. Everything about that sounds like me.

False,1,"As far as the article goes, the Wiki admins are currently separating the Legends content from the Canon content in order to clean up and organize the wiki before a butt load of new info comes in when The Force Awakens releases. So some parts of articles will be out of access for another few days.
    I wouldn't be too upset about the changing of EU Canon to legends. It's an effort to clean it up so new fans aren't overwhelmed, and Lucasfilm has gone on record stating that a lot of Legends material holds truth. That means you can believe whatever you want about what happened, it just may not necessarily be canon."
False,1,"Hi there, 

Disney established their own Star Wars continuity in order to give J.J. Abrams and other producers more flexibility and room to maneuver when producing the new Sequel Trilogy and other future films. Having spent my teenage years immersing myself in the world of the Expanded Universe, I can understand your frustration and angst. There were some outstanding elements of the old EU like the Thrawn Trilogy, Darth Bane, Knights of the Old Republic, and the Lost Tribes of the Sith stories. However, there were also a lot of plot continuity contradictions. One good example would be AOTC saying that the Republic is 1,000 years old while older EU literature like the Essential Chronology says that it is 25,000 years old. That's why some EU authors had to create the Ruusan Reformation to retcon this problem. Concerning your question about not being able to load the Legends part of the Coruscant article, bots are working on Wookieepedia to rearrange the website to emphasize the canon elements first. So there will be some disruption. "
False,0,In my opinion Clone Wars is a lot less childish then Rebels and is a bit easier to connect with the characters then it is for Rebels.   
False,0,Clone wars Rebels is to drawn out and the clone wars actually told a story that you read in book and I know both of them are but clone wars was canon and clone wars was better overall
False,0,"Clone Wars is much deeper and has better writing, but I like Rebels due to all new villians such as Inquisitors and the Seventh Sister as well as a return of a much stronger Ahsoka Tano. "
False,0,The only think about rebels it is a bit to kiddish 
False,0,That R both amazing 
False,0,Loved clone wars but rebels is growing on me
False,0,Both are great. But best start with clone wars for spoiler reasons. Aka Fulcrum
False,0,Rebels in my opinion is better so far. Clone Wars is still great but Ezra is so cool and seeing a character progress and get more powerful over time is better than a character being powerful from the start and never progressing. Chopper and Zeb are also awesome. 
False,0,The animation for Rebels makes it look like some kind of toddler's TV show.
False,2,"It's amazing how so many here love Clone Wars and dislike Rebels due to rose-colored tinted glasses of Nostalgia.

Clone Wars did not get great until S3 begins, and even then there are many filler episodes. The animation was -- to put it nicely -- ""interesting"", with plasticine faces and hair made out of cardboard.

I have the complete set of TCW, and I'm following SWR closely, and I can say with great honesty and without any persuasion, that SWR is better.

The story develops better. The animation is better. It is setting down a significant amount of New Canon. It opens up new storyline possibilities so we are not limited to the ""rail shooter"" that is the Numbered Episodes.

And it's just in its second season. Not yet 1.5 seasons has been aired, and many ""old school"" Star Wars fans -- including those who *actually* watched the Original Trilogy in the theaters -- are admitting, albeit sometimes begrudgingly, that it's a good show."
False,2,"The new canon sucks, in my opinion. Hate it."
False,2,"Basically, anything official ""Star Wars"" that was put out before April 25, 2014 is now considered ""Legends,"" save the six main movies, the Clone Wars film and the Clone Wars TV series. Those exceptions and everything official released after April 25, 2014 is considered canon, again with certain exceptions, such as a few things that are intentional continuations of Legends stories and certain comic material that is explicitly non-canon like ""Angry Birds: Star Wars."" And the reason it's so hotly debated is because a lot of people were fans of the old Legends stuff like Mara Jade Skywalker and the Thrawn books, and don't like that it's all essentially non-canon now."
False,1,"Put simply, Legends refers to all Star Wars media (novels, comics, TV shows, etc.) released prior to 2014. In 2014, Disney made the decision to reboot the Legends continuity, and announced that all upcoming media (i.e. Rebels, Episode VII) would form the new Star Wars canon. It's heavily debated because many fans were committed to the Legends universe, some for decades, and they feel the reboot is unfair to their commitment."
False,1,I hate the new canon to the point were I refuse to read or watch it. Even the new movies. The old EU was the golden days.
False,2,"While I dislike things such as the Yuuzhan Vong War, I love the Legends EU; it's the reason I became involved with Star Wars in the first place. However, the new universe is an incredible chance for better stories and a more cohesive narrative (plus it's really exciting to see it grow). All-in-all, I like both."
False,1,"Right? I honestly love the EU, it has plot holes but IMO they weren't huge. Dark Forces was amazing, along with Thrawn Trilogy, etc."
False,3,"The Old EU will certainly never die in terms of existing. I for one will always treasure the Dark Forces Saga. Now if someone found a way to simply destroy everything from the EU, like through raids or something, then we'd have a problem. "

False,1,"Why consider either non-canon? The easiest way to look at the legends and canon situation is to consider them separate continuities, both of which can co-exist. The Marvel comics have loads of separate continuities, many of which are fantastic.  "
False,0,You're very narrow minded Jace Onasi.
False,1,I consider everything in the new system that was not made before April 25th 2014 to be non-canon.
False,1,"That may be the original meaning for Legends, but with so many ""non-canon within the new canon continuity"" materials being released, it will be much easier to brand non-canon things as ""Legends"".

It's also a much shorter label: 41 characters versus 7 :-)"
False,1,"P.S. - technically, ""Legends"" is a marketing term, as is ""Infinities."" Wookieepedia considers anything from ""Infinities"" non-canon, but just because something is non-canon doesn't mean it's ""Infinities."" Same for ""Legends."""
False,1,"Not quite. Legends does not equal non-canon. For example, the ""Star Wars: Epic Yarns"" are listed as non-canon, but we don't call that ""Legends."" We list them as ""non-canon within the new canon continuity."" ""Legends"" is a term for material originating before April 25, 2014, which may include old non-canon material. But those non-canon stories may still have included stuff such as Mara Jade Skywalker which was part of the old ""Legends"" continuity. But if something goofy like ""Angry Birds"" or something includes Ezra Bird-er or something, that's just ""non-canon,"" not ""Legends."""
False,1,"Why absurd? If it's determined to be not part of Canon, it gets branded as ""Legends""; it's a designation for ""Non Canon"", not a simple rebranding of old EU.

The ""Legends"" label is a very good initiative to properly separate Canon Material with non-canon media."
False,0,Yes
False,0,Depends which side they are on...
False,0,"The reason why stormtroopers can't aim is because they were normal people trained by the empire. While clone troopers were genetically breed by kaminoans.

That's why the only stormtroopers who ever hit their mark were the ones at the beginning of A New Hope, Darth Vaders army"

Just read the latest Star Wars comics; you can see Han and Chewie wielding lightsabers. They are not Force sensitives. Of course, that means they wield them clumsily and just as some blunt weapons. And most likely won't be able to deflect incoming blasters shots.

But in a pinch, any individual -- Force sensitive or not -- can wield a lightsaber as a replacement for a baseball bat."
False,2,"If you read the article on midi-chlorians, it says that midi-chlorians can be used to keep an individual alive way past the point where they should have died (i.e. Keeping Grievous alive while transplanting only his vital organs into a new body), but the midi-chlorians don't enhance the individual's force-sensitivity.

That being said, like the EU, there's great stuff and some cheesy stuff.  However I think cannon is learning from EU mistakes like revisiting every location in the OT and exaggerated coincidences of  minor characters effects. . .

False,1,"That said, I loved Tarkin(Really felt movie material) and The Weapon of a Jedi.

I do miss a ton of stuff from the old EU though. They treated it like it was insignificant and didn't matter. But had no problem raiding it's coffers for tons of things instead of coming up with new things in their place.

False,0,Mark Hamill once said that he doesn't want anyone to leak the next film on the internet (see the article on The force Awakens.)
False,1,"The easy solution is to just avoid the wikia until you see the film. If you can't manage that, then all our pages related to the new film are marked with a special spoilers tag at the top warning you not to read them. There's no need to be concerned about the lockdown as it will only last a few days, after which editing will return as normal. "
False,0,I just don't read cannon articles which is pretty easy considering how many more legends articles there are 
True,1,"Well, this is a Wiki, where we include all spoilers. I am too, concerned about the lockdown, but mainly I just find that it is retarded, as I hate canon, and love Legends."

False,0,"I heard that rumor from the Colider Jedi Council. They think that A) he may return in a flash back, but star wars never has done flashbacks in the past. 
B) as a force ghost
C) as Darth Vader in Rogue One

I'm hoping on C"
False,0,"How would they bring him back though? At the end of his life he converged back to the light side. It is shown that the Sith can create matter out of Midi-chlorians (See Great Experiment) but Anakin manifests in the force. If he was to make a return would he have the knowledge to ""reincarnate"" in a sense? "
False,0,"I hope so TBH. It's funny how when this rumor started. People were all of a sudden ""Ok it's time to let Vader go"". So THAT's where they draw the line at pandering.

But really, if they do. I'll be glad. He wasn't ever a bad actor, EPII wasn't the best (Even though I enjoy it immensely). But based on his performance in EPIII, I welcome that they were willing to go for consistency and bring him back. Anakin Skywalker as a FG could never have been a middle aged man. Nor was Anakin Skywalker ever a Jedi as a middle aged man. It is as Obi-Wan said ""Darth Vader betrayed and murdered your father"". When the glint of light deep inside Vader finally awoke. Anakin Skywalker the Jedi was reborn. So the former visage of himself as a Jedi makes sense as a FG. "
False,0,"Yah, Portman wasn't too amazing in the prequels. Which is weird, because she has done great work in other films. I mean, I think TPM was sort of like near the start of her career, and her better films were later on. "

False,0,No but ive heard about ewan mcgregor wanne do more Work through star wars

False,1,"I don't think Kyle Katarn will ever make it to canon. Aspects of his story -- even including his romantic relation ship with a goggle-wearing pilot -- seems to have been absorbed, in part or in whole, into the character of Kanan Jarrus."
False,0,"I agree. I'm a new fan, and all that legends literally gave me a migraine the whole day. "
False,0,"I really like Caedus, one of my favorite Sith. But since they made him related to Luke it has to change. I would go crazy if it turned out Kylo was a version of Caedus. I doubt it though. I don't get why people like Katarn so much though. "
False,1,"I thought Finn was the new Kyle Katarn, both are storm troopers gone Jedi. So it makes sense."
False,0,"Ugh, don't remind me. He should've been a key character in Rogue One. If he is reduced to nothing more than a visual cameo or something in Disney Canon. I'll be one huge sad panda.

""But Caedus, Katarn, cloned emperor, all of that is gone. ""

And really only ONE of those things was worth getting rid of.

Caedus is Kylo Ren (Though with his character warped to suit their needs of a vessel for what those OT fans thought Anakin Skywalker was all along and not as TPM or the PT disappointed them. Always some kind of badass, strong in the darkside. Potentially inherently evil though he feels he is doing the ""right"" thing.)

Cloned Emperor, despite now at this point the plausibility of it. Was a strange storyline. Almost up there with turds like Aftermath and The Crystal Star."
False,0,Chances of Katarn returning to the new timeline are slim. But if it happened I would explode from the joy. 
False,3,"I actually like what disney did. The lore got messy because there was conflicting accounts and too much. This time they are rewriting it to make sense. People like Bane and Revan still count I think, because they are to important to cancel. But Caedus, Katarn, cloned emperor, all of that is gone. "
False,2,Don't think so. He is a Legends character. Blame Disney.
False,0,Is Boba Fett surviving canon?
False,0,"The jetpack didn't break, it just malfunctioned.
Boba is alive and well and leader of the mandalorians."
False,0,No Bobo died because Han hit his jetpack launching him into a Bariff going into the pit.
False,0,A combination of his armor and extreme will to survive. Pretty sure boba used a missile to blow it up

False,0,"Phew, thankfully I'm now working mainly with Canon articles. I still work on the occasional Legends article but I guess it takes time to get used to new things. "
False,0,"Probably the same. Editing will become funky to a degree, as now we'll have to do Subject/Legends probably instead of Subject/Canon. It'll be a bit bothersome for Legends article authors, I suppose. "

False,0,He died in 6 rewatch the movies
False,0,In the EU he got out of the sarlacc and I hope they keep it that way. And Tamwarea Morison is the perfect age
False,1,I don't know why they'd want to keep Boba Fett dead. He's one of the things from the OT that is ripe with potential for great stories and characterization.
False,0,I would agree if you pay attention the mandalorian death watching symbol is visible in the trailer it is the same one that is on bobas shoulder so I would expect to see him or mandalore come into play
False,1,I'd say another Mandalore will come into play. They will keep him killed off after return of the Jedi

False,0,"The EU doesn't exist in the movie universe. Though some of it can, the solo twins is one aspect that I believe won't"
False,0,Wouldn't Kylo Ren be referred to as Darth Caedus then? And what would be the cause of Jacen Solo's obsession of Vader's work?
False,0,"I hope not but it seems to be that way. They seem to twist that to their own needs instead of keeping the characters the same and putting it into a new canon. (Because it's not like the OT enough. And you know they have to pander to that vocal minority of OT fans)

Rather than making Jacen a Vader like figure by Default and Rey the innocent naive girl from a desert planet. Aka making her the Luke like figure.

I really wish we'd see Lowbacca though. Wookiee Jedi fucking yes.

As Vader, he had a lot of it taken away, but was still the second most powerful being in the galaxy. He was 8/10 of Palpatine's.
"
False,0,Anakin was the most powerful
False,0,I do not believe he was the most powerful. He was the one who brought balance to the force (depending on your point of view); just because he brought balance doesn't mean he was the most powerful imo. 
False,0,"Well, most of the Jedi fell to Darth Vader, and because Obi-Wan almost killed him and was capable of doing so, that would make him the strongest. But that would make Qui-Gon stronger, because he trained Obi-Wan, Dooku stronger because he trained Qui-Gon, and Yoda stronger than all of them,  because he trained Dooku. Plus Yoda trained Luke, who came 2nd closest to killing Vader. That might indicate Yoda being strongest."
False,0,I was always lead to believe that mace windu was the strongest Jedi and some where I read that he would have be above yoda put turned down leading the council to concentrate on his training. 
False,0,"Luke is not the best when it comes to fighting, force affinity, etc. He is just the coolest and most popular. Obi-Wan during the Clone Wars was better and so was Anakin before he was dismembered. Mace Windu, Ki Adi--Mundi, Aayla Secura, Plo Koon, all of these people could beat Episode 6 Luke in a duel. "
False,1,"I think we all know that Anikan Skywalker was the most powerful when he was not robotic Vader. However he was dismembered by Obi Wan on Mustafar and that took away a considerable amount of his midiclhorians. This means his force potential was severely hindered. Like was the closest in terms of raw power to what Anikan Skywalker possessed. We so even though he was unable to defeat the Emperor, you must also realize that he was only about the level of a Jedi Knight during his second and final bout with Vader . This means that despite his raw power in the force he did not have the knowledge needed to possess a great skill set with it. While Vader and the Emperor did . They had years upon years of training plus much more experience in fighting other force welders. Luke had only ever fought his father. I think that Luke was without a doubt the most powerful, it just took him a very long time to get to that point.

False,1,"@Dotsie not necessarily. There might be a ""minimum height requirement"" to be a stormtrooper, and Luke didn't quite make that requirement."
False,0,Stromtroopers are not clones exposing there different sizes
False,0,"*don't take me seriously on the lousy aim, not the rest of the comment."
False,1,"However, in Episode IV Leia remarks that Luke (disguised as a stormtrooper) is ""a little short for a stormtrooper"" implying that they are all the same height. However, I am fully aware that they are not clones, because clones have twice the growth span of people, indicating that by Episode IV, they would be to old to fight. (but that could justify their lousy aim.)
( Lol don't take me seriously on that.)"
False,1,"In Battlefront 2 it was explained that an insurrection on Kamino shortly after the end of the Clone Wars caused the Empire to destroy all Kaminoan clone factories. So instead of creating more clones, the Empire recruited soldiers from all over the Galaxy as well as utilized clones from a couple other templates. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, Jango Fett clones were a minority within the Stormtrooper corps. "

False,1,"The old EU, or ""Legends"", had become a cesspool with good writing, bad writing, and outright toxic writing.

The worst part was that some of the good writing referenced things in the bad- or toxic-writing pool.

Rather than trying to sort out the spaghetti mess, which will still cause a lot of protests anyways, Lucasfilm took the easier -- and much cleaner -- decision to just do away with the whole EU.

Start from a clean slate, and build up from that, under the guidance of the Lucasfilm Story Group.

Besides, the way they de-canonized the old EU, by saying that ""some truths might be found in them thar hills"", allows elements from the old EU to be recanonized into the New Integrated Interconnected Canon. And I am 100% content with that.

(In fact, guessing which elements of Legends will next make it into the New Canon, has become a very enjoyable game for me and some of my friends :D)"

False,0,"I heard that they canceled the EU because of a few reasons. One of them being because they already made so many books, in order to make another movie, they would have had to make a full book or a partial book into the movie."
False,0,And BB8 is real. It isn't CGI. Look up Star Wars Celebration BB8
False,0,BB-8 is actually inspired by original R2-D2 concept art.

False,0,Holocrons
False,0,"There are plenty of ways that Kylo could have been trained, most of them mentioned in this post already. He could have been found and trained by Snoke, he could be a former Jedi of Luke's Order that deserted and found a Sith Holocron to learn from, he could have been a normal (yet Force-Sensitive) dude that found a Sith Holocron, he could have simply found through some extreme circumstance that he was Force-Sensitive and giving into his anger and emotions made him more powerful, at which point Snoke found him and trained him in Saber combat, plenty more. "
False,0,I bet he found Darth Bane's holocron. 
False,0,Sith holocrons 
False,0,He made his own lightsaber so u guess he trained him self.
False,0,He was trained under supreme leader snoke

False,0,Both!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
False,0,No they cancelled 1313 I will never forgive  
False,0,"I loved the EU and find it incredible that such a thing existed by so many people. Most stories were awesome and helped explain a multitude of things. And the post film-era stories were really interesting.
 But I'll admit that it was chaotic."
False,0,I CANT WAIT!!!
False,0,"Kylo Ren is just Kylo Ren, he is not the apprentice of Vader. He is an admirer or the work of the Sith and seeks to avenge the fallen Lord. Ren is also not Skywalker."
False,0,Watch Kylo Ren be Chewbacca. That would be funny
False,0,"I also like to hope that it lines up a little bit with what has been going on in Rebels... Perhaps Kylo is some sort of Inquisitor? Or used to be anyway, but we will have to wait and see"
False,0,I like to think that Luke kept going where Obi-Wan and the other Jedi left off... Key word is I like to think... To be honest I think we will all be surprised with the out come of the new movie.
False,0,No Darth plageus was murdered by palpatine himself while he was asleep 
False,0,Sorry Kylo
False,0,I think kilo ren's name is Kilo Ren
False,0,Kylo is following in Vaders footsteps to make a great empire but Vader didn't help constructing the empire Palpatine did

Boba Fett cannonically is seen to have a rocket launcher in his jetpack and wrist. Flamethrower, lassoo-thingy and he has the E-33. His equipment though is rusty.

They both have Jetpacks.
And they are both heroes wo will be remembered!"

False,0,Jango fett
False,0,Jango Fett for sure.

False,0,BOBA FOR THE WIN 
False,0,"Basically Boba's equipment, all of it, is his sleepy hollow pops' equipment. It gets Well Used & BrOKEN IN over the years. If you like one, you like the other.

False,0,Sith Lord cause screw being a puny assassin with a white light saber like mace windus

False,0,"Interesting, raises questions."
False,0,"Really cool, reminds me of Darth Maul lightsaber > I like that the dark side get to have cool ones "
False,0,Looks sweet
False,0,I think it was Palpatines influence that steered him towards the dark side. It was the deny of rank of master that just put the jedi council on Anakins hit list. 
False,0,But anakin was way too young. I remember obi wan telling him that he should be honored that he was even on the council at such a young age. It was anakin who turned himself to the dark side 
False,0,"An akin was bad to being with he was very outspoken and against the rule and beyond that he had marriage which was looked down upon beside ki adi mundi and plo koon, marriage as a Jedi could lead to the obsession of losing a loved one and anakin was prime example, he could've turned away from padmé and became a powerful Jedi but succumbed to his weaknesses"
False,0,"I think now matter what, Anakin was heading down a bad path. I believe the Jedi councils decision sped up the process. "
False,0,"As good as they are. I don't think that the Lego games have ever been considered canon, even before the Disney takeover.

False,0,"This is non-canon, but in Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga, he can hover in every level."
False,0,"When the jawas took him, they burnt his feet, so I guess the jets came off"

False,0,"There is a rumor about it that Jar Jar was going to be the sith lord above Sidious. But after how the public reacted to Jar Jar in episode 1. His whole story was changed so they through in some fallen jedi, Dooku, and he became a background character. 

There is a quote from Lucas saying that Jar Jar is the key to everything. 

I don't know how true this rumor is though"
False,0,Jar Jar is simply Jar Jar. No more. No less. He is definitely not a Sith Lord. 
False,0,It's hilarious how everyone hates Jar Jar Binks 
False,0,Thank goodness 
False,0,Anyways JarJar should have been way to old by now for him to be alive

False,0,"First of all,even if these new 😠DISNEY😠 trilogy movies don't end up seeming like they were made by Jar Jar Binks,what's up with everyone taking episode 7 like names. Less you forget except for 5 year olds,Disney has made only 2 worthwhile endeavors. The original TRON,and 1920's-30's B&W non Mickey Mouse cartoons. Disney fired or let leave 90% of everyone that's been part of Star Wars,Lucas film,I.L.M. took the comic's from Dark Horse and gave them to Marvel,just to make a $ because they own Marvel,And worst of all say 20 year's of expanded universe is no longer canon. It seems the dark side has won!  DARTH JUSTICE..."
False,0,Yes and I wish they would show more about bounty hunters and go into more depth with them.
False,0,Totally agree!
False,0,Definitely.    Would've been awesome if it were in Canon more....but same can be said for Boba
False,0,i actually do 
False,0,"Perhaps in Legends, but canonically he just stands on the bridge on the Executor and gets hired to track down the Millennium Falcon and her crew."
False,0,Yeah
False,0,"Neither. Luke would be stronger, due to being able to resist the dark side, but he would never kill his daddy!"
False,0,"Anakin. Luke wouldn't stand a chance. 
"
False,0,Luke would win because Anakin obviously can't bring himself to kill his son!
False,0,Anakin would win. 
False,0,I'd say Anakin > before he joined The dark side > he has far more training and altogether talent than Luke 
False,0,"Anakin, because with anger, you can unlock more power and rage"
False,0,Anakin was really fast so I think he could take both of Luke's hands off (including prosthetic) before Luke even blinks. 
False,1,But Luke like his father showed extreme prowess with his light saber fight when he momentarily tapped into the dark side vs Darth Vader 
False,0,Luke
False,1,"
Ever see Luke destroy Jedi temples, slaughter rooms full of people, swing over lava, and nearly defeat one Kenobi (sans being a dumbass)

Remember, Vaders suit was crap.  And given 1983 technology, limited Anakins moves and saber prowess

Evin then, you're talking what 15-20 years of Jedi training, saber and war experience vs what, maybe a few days in a swap? "

False,0,The real question is who is Supreme Leader Snoke

False,0,"Clone wars and movies happen in the same universe. Both are canon. But agreed, he was greatly underused in EP1. Though he was redeemed in the clone wars, he was still underused in the movies"

False,0,"If Darth Maul had not died there would be no count dokuu, no dokuu no death star"
False,0,One million percent. He was a better sigh than Count and the closest thing to Darth Vader.
False,0,"I do agree, Maul was such an amazing Sith. I think that Lucas just wanted to make a random Sith for the Jedi to battle. "
False,0,I agree 
False,0,"I heard the Lucas once said he regretted killing Maul off so early, as that would have given Kenobi a rival throughout the series ( not to mention the opportunity to see Maul on Genosis going through Jedis and or Clones)

Where it would complicate matters is the Rule of Two, unless of course he was introduced as the assassin and the apprentice as he's defined in Plagues etc.

"
False,0,One of the problems of the prequels was the lack of a constant villain (besides Sidious). Darth maul should not have been killed that early 
False,1,"Darth Maul's actual death is not recorded. In the Clone Wars TV show, he shows up quite a lot (in Season 3 & 4 I believe). He is still alive as far as we know at the end of the war. Check it out!"
False,0,"^Yeah, but that would be a re-hash of the original trilogy rather than a subtle parallel like they had throughout the prequels. If Maul had killed Qui Gon and then escaped, that would have been exactly like Vader killing Obi-Wan right in front of Luke. That's a bit too similar of an event for a movie trilogy that's supposed to set the scene for the originals, in my opinion. "

False,1,"Double bladed. You could just have two lightsabers but that just takes force from your attacks.
Also you would have to move them even when not attacking to distract your opponent but with a double blade it does that out of its own.
With a double bladed lightsaber your moves are stronger wich helps your attack, defense and is reinforced by Vaapad.
With two, you're just a bit more unpredictable. "
False,0,"I like dooku though
In his prime I think he could beat Vader"
False,0,"With or without the suit and all appendages intact?
"
False,0,"If you're talking about Sith Lords in Canon, then yes. Maul is more powerful than Dooku. Otherwise, Luke was able to defeat Vader, so he would possibly defeat Maul. In non-canon, I'd say Galen Marek. He beat Vader twice, the second time with minimal effort and while being attacked by force-sensitive clones."

False,0,The story line isn't the original one. Disney changed it
False,0,"It's impossible for Jar Jar Binks to be a sith Lord. It is obvious the events on Naboo were to put Darth Sidious (Palpatine) into power. The Rule of Two states that there can only be two sith lords: a Master and an Apprentice. Darth Plagues was the master of Palpatine and was killed after Palpatine was put into power. If Jar Jar was the Master, Count Dooku would have been killed by Jar Jar because it is forbidden for the apprentice to have an apprentice (this is what happens in the Force Unleashed videogame, Darth Vader has an apprentice: Starkiller). I am not exactly sure but I believe the order of the clone army by Master Sifo-Dyas (persuaded by Darth Plagueis and his Jedi friend Dooku) was under the administration of the previous Chancellor. Therefore, I believe the clone army was in production during the events of Naboo. Jar Jar Binks, if he was a Sith Lord would have destroyed his apprentice Palpatine, Dooku, and Darth Vader. Jar Jar Binks is said to have still been in the Galactic Senate, so obviously he is still around, but would have perfect access to slaughter both Sith Lords Sidious and Vader. This does not happen. If Jar Jar is indeed a force user, wouldn't he have attempted to defer young Anakin to the dark side early? Anakin is the Chosen One, prophesized to bring balance to the force. Jar Jar Binks would have had the perfect advantage to convert him at a young age."
False,0,Bull crap
False,0,"Heh I think it's hysterical, and question the sobriety of the one who came up with it 
"
False,0,Does he seem like Sith material to you?
False,0,"I don't believe so. 
"
False,0,"I don't think people understand jar jar binks purpose in star wars he is there to bring some humor to the movies I mean the theory is a little far fetch but you don't have to go all out on jar jar I mean imagine starwars without jar jar and you who hate him might say it will be pretty awesome but and am taking about the PT here would be a little to serious and people would still have arguments about the move and if you think am wrong imagine the OT with out  Han Solo how would that be Jar jar binks is han solo with out a blaster and commonsense.
"
False,0,"It's such a stupid theory, like seriously, Jar-Jar Binks? It was just a stupid meme saying he's the worst sith lord just because he annoyed people the most, but now people are saying he really is? It's just downright stupid..."
False,0,There would be riots. But maybe they're inevitable.
False,0,Is jar jar going to be in the new movie? IF SO. ... Major Fail 
False,0,"Yes, I agree. They should have lasted at least for a few more seconds. Until only Windu and one other were left. Then they would fight sidious together. Just to show how powerful he was. Then somehow, the other was killed while showing compassion or something. And so on"
False,0,I would've have liked to see kit fisto and the two other jedi last for a little while longer but I think them being killed off so soon added to the pace and emotion of those scenes leading up to order 66 and the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader.
False,0,"I would tend to think it showed the power of Sidious, strength of Windo, and the theory that Sideous had foreseen the scenario to get Anakin to turn, so he ""let""  Mace appear to beat him and scar his face 

Also, this can count on  the  list of cinematics and sub three hour time constraints. . . But remember, before then we never saw The Emperor/Sidious with a light saber, nor knew he even had one, then all the sudden he drops three or Jedi, so when you watched it the first time at the midnight showing . . .wow! 


But an large scale battle between them would have been awesome"
False,0,"No, it showed how powerful Sidious is."
False,0,Sidious OP
False,0,"It was surprise. They didn't expect that to happen, and Sidious shielded his thoughts so well that they couldn't predict his actions. And, as skilled as they are, Sidious is much more so. "
False,0,"Yeah they definetely should have made at least Kit Fisto more powerful, we should have seen him in an epic saber fight, what actually happened was very underwhelming "
False,0,"I know how you feel, like you got cheated out of a more epic battle/struggle . Especially since all 4 jedi were of high caliber , not just windu. A surprise attack doesn't quite cut it, especially with weapons drawn out already."
False,0,They had been warned about him though. 
False,0,"Well would you expect some old man who seemed to be friendly to you all the sudden come flying at you with a saber?

No"
False,0,"I think if there was ever a time for ahsoka in live action, it was in the prequel era. 

And I don't see Kanon being in the Saga films. In an Anthology, maybe, but I'm not holding my breath because his story is in Rebels, The Kanon comics and A New Dawn novel, he does cover across more platforms than most characters already"
False,0,No
False,0,I think Vader will kill her in Rebels.

False,0,It's not that good to be honest
False,0,Aftermath was an awful book in my opinion..
False,0,"I have, and I'm guessing the second book might focus on Chewie and Han, mostly because of the Falcon on the cover and how Chewbacca owes Han a life debt"
False,0,"I have. Looks pretty cool! And it may suggest that a certain plotline from Aftermath will be continued, which would be pretty cool."
False,0,I have.
False,0,"Don't get too engrossed in the EU because they aren't official star wars anymore. More closely related to glorified fan fiction, no offense. There are several canon novels coming out frequently that are worth the read, excluding Aftermath.

False,0,Thanks for all the advice guys
False,0,Play video games that are fun but reading the stuff is a waste of time. They aren't cannon so no point in it. They are fun but... They are irrelevant. Just watch Rebels and Clone Wars. 
False,0,"I'd try the new Battlefront book first.  It has familiar moments (i.e. The Battle of Hoth) with little or no ""main character"" involvement 

I'd avoid Heir to The Empire and beyond.  While good to great, they where done before 1-3 and are missing no known events with extremely extrapolated reasoning.  While needed at the time, now it just doesn't work"
False,0,"Kotor II is a masterpiece, TOR and Zahn's Thrawn books are a waste of time- they're cheesy nonsense. 
"
False,1,"KOTOR's okay, but not great. The Thrawn Trilogy is absolutely the best starting place. From there, just kind of explore what you like most. Since you like the OT, you'll probably like Rebellion-New Republic-New Jedi Order eras, and X-Wing is a good place to start there. Wookieepedia's a great way to research this kind of thing. "
False,0,Play kotor!!!!
False,2,You should read the Thrawn trilogy set right after return of the Jedi. 
False,1,You should try playing Star Wars the old republic great game with great story. It is set during the old republic era.
False,1,"Reading the books can definitely help you learn more, as well as the comics. But considering you have this wiki, I'm sure you can learn about it on here.. But to me this is more complicated. (:"
False,0,In the clone wars we only saw one clone commando so I guess that would mean they are more rare right?
False,0,"NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT! COMPLETE REVERSE OF THAT! ARC troopers are incredibly rare, and extremely skilled. There are only 106 ""true"" ARC troopers (not counting the ones TCW made up like Fives and Echo); six Null-class trained by Kal Skirata, and 100-Alpha class, trained by Jango himself. Clone commandoes, while still extremely skilled, are much more common, with 10,000 in the galaxy. ARC troopers are trained for solo missions, though occasionally work in small groups or in support of non-ARC operations. Commandoes are trained in squads of four, and are rarely separated from their squadmates. "
False,0,I hope that helps. 
False,1,Commandos are much more elite and specialized. Their equipment and armor is much more advanced and they're rarer in the battlefield. Arc's are more common and are just clones with extra training and more elite.
False,0,I heard that JJ Abrams personally buried the bones of Jar Jar Binks in the desert of Jakku. So maybe we see his corpse.  Fingers crossed
False,0,I highly doubt that he will make an appearance. 
False,1,look on jakku. Abrams has said he sneaked his skeleton somewhere in the film
False,0,But if he's a Sith couldn't he have managed to live longer?
False,1,"The odds are very, very slim. A Gungan's lifespan is typically 65 galactic years (not entirely confirmed but has been stated by multiple sources) and according to his Bio he was born 51 BBY which would place him well over his life span in the force awakes. "
False,0,Are you kidding me? He's not going to be in it because he would serve no purpose.

False,0,Hoop43 that's a good idea but the timeline doesn't add up cuz the actor is barely 30 and this movie is set 30 years after vader died
False,0,Yeah that's a good idea! ^^
False,0,My guess is somewhere along the line Kylo was an apprentice to Vader. In which he has sought out to avenge him. 
False,0,"Yes his mother died, but Vader could have met another woman during his time on the Empire. "
False,0,"Luke could not possibly have a brother. He was the firstborn twin, and his mother died after he and Leia were born."

False,0,"That may be true. Doesn't explain why her new ones emit a white light now though. 

Can the order confiscate your saber if you leave the order? Dooku kept possession of his when he left. He merely changed out crystals to emit a red color. "

False,1,"Do you mean The Clone Wars? If so, that was always canon - it was an official George Lucas production, and always part of his official vision for the saga."
False,0,*maul< Dooku 
False,0,Maul was kinda a scrub who could only be used as an assassin. Dooku was far more useful to him. In the legends maul doesn't die either he duels Obi wan in tatooine In the time between revenge of the sith And new hope. In short maul>Dooku 
False,0,"I'd been aware of Wookieepedia since elementary school, but I didn't begin editing until May of last year, shortly after the declaration of the new canon."
False,0,How did you first become aware of Wookieepedia? Have you ever edited on the wiki before? You should - you can do it with the account you're using in this very forum!
False,0,Maybe they try to rebuild it in exile?
False,0,"I think Luke is probably in exile for sure. (SPOILER ALERT) Leia is now a general and the leader of the Resistance, so she's not in exile. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Resistance"
False,0,"Han Solo does not turn to the dark side.
How could you!"
False,0,"For the first comment, Luke does appear in one of the trailers. He is also already considered a Jedi Master come episode 6 and If I recall, in the expanded universe (now legends) they attempt to rebuild the Jedi order and he trains both Han and Leia in the ways of the force and both become jedi along with their kids however Hans son turns to the dark side thus the fall of the whole thing and then Luke goes into exile from his failure.

But again, that's all legend so who know what will come with episode 7."
False,0,And luke is already a jedi
False,0,Leia is force sensitive but i dont think she will become a jedi
False,0,But what about the Jedi Order? They just buzz off and forget about  rebuilding it? I don't think so.
False,0,"That would also explained why Rey and Finn didn't know about the Jedi (besides the ""stories"" Rey had heard, which she didn't seem to initially believe)."
False,0,Luke definitely doesn't appear in the trailer so it's a reasonable  prediction.

Any idea what's up with Ahsoka's new white lightsabers instead of her yellow/green ones? Does this mean she is a Grey Jedi?? "
False,0,"It's a sure thing that it's possible. We saw her pose as Asajj Ventress with a similar mask as to that of which the lady inquisitor dons in Rebels. We also know she is very good with droids, and Offee is as well. To the point that Asohka didn't recognize her? Well, I'm not sure. Any more thoughts?"
False,2,Probably not. Ahsoka didn't react when she saw her in the most recent episode. Plus I never saw Barriss as being all-out evil. I don't think she would join the Empire.
False,1,Is not her! In the last episode Ahsoka fought her and she didnt even react as if she knew who she was. =) is a new character.
False,1,"She never had dual green sabers, just one green and one yellow shoot"
False,1,I wonder where Ashoka's green dual sabers are
False,0,"I would love to see this twist. Also, with Ashoka's tight relationship with Barriss, it would play our super cool to see one of them show mercy instead of taking their life in a showdown "
False,0,"It's possible
She probably broke out of prison after the Jedi purge"
False,0,Interceptor

False,0,"And the prize goes to the Sun Crusher!
For near-invincible armor, a weapon more powerful than the Death Star, a cool name and being cannon this starfighter is the best in the History of the Universe.
Better than the Star Forge, the Death Star, the Death Sabre or any other superweapon.
Thank you WookieCookies for finding the most OP starfighter in the Galaxy of Star Wars!"
False,0,The sun crusher 
False,0,"Yes but the Interceptor has no shields or hyperdrive making it reliant on Star Destroyers and the X-Wing has been proven to be weaker than other snubfighters like the ARC-170.
Thank you for answering!"
False,0,"Tie interceptor or x-wing starfighter. Both are fast, agile, and heavily armed. The interceptor's biggest advantage is speed and modularity. X-wing is tough and also has a shield."
False,0,"Okay so the First Order TIE Fighter looks just like a TIE Fighter and I do not know enough about it to say anything on the subject.
The Bladewing  (B-Wing) is a very manoeuvrable starfighter  that has been known to singlehandedly destroy entire Victory Class Star Destroyers.
The Skyhopper looks a bit bulky but has proven to be pretty good though I think it's just an atmospherical fighter and that limits it a ton.
Out of the three I'd choose the B-Wing but I already knew of it's existence and It hasn't really convinced me as the best starfighter.
Thanks anyway!

And yeah, I'm boycotting every canonical SW content (with an exception of Tarkin, but only because it was written by Jim Luceno). Movies included."
False,0,"No point in quitting the EU. It could be simply continued as an alternate universe in form of books and possibly comics (Marvel managed this, but Lucasfilm cannot, of course). The rest would be canon with this Kylo Ren, Rebels and so on. Our money were good to Lucasfilm, but they still happilly stabbed a dagger in our backs. Moreover, by employing people like Chuck Wendig, who publicly offended SW fans, Lucasfilm shows that they really don't care for their fans -  neither the old ones (thanks for the money, EU is dead, buy this new rebooted canon) nor the new ones. By the way ---"
False,0,Pardon me but we are not just a tiny fraction!
False,0,"It wasn't a matter of making the continuity work. It was a matter of creating a story that worked for all audiences. When you think about how much had happened in the EU after Return of the Jedi, there was just too much baggage to make a movie series for everyone. The target audience is the whole world, not just the tiny fraction of Star Wars book readers."
False,0,"I hope Mara Jade appears in the new canon, Thrawn too"
False,0,"Just to clear it out: Only things that are canon now are the movies 1-6, the future trilogy, the newer Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: Rebels. But i agree, the EU had so many cool stories and characters."
False,1,But I agree. I miss the EU :(
False,1,"Actually, hate break it to you, but it's not just post-Endor that's been tossed. It's the entire EU. Everything that's not the movies, The Clone Wars, and all the stuff they've done. "

False,0,"When Maul came back in TCW, Disney didn't own star wars then. Plus that was at the request of Lucas himself. As for Ahsoka, she is Filonis character that only he can touch"
False,0,Darth Maul coming back was before Disney.
False,0,"I have to disagree with you, Hyger3. I don't think Rebels feels like Star Wars at all. I think it feels like utter misery. "
False,1,"Darth Maul came back before Disney acquired Star Wars, and George Lucas and Dave Filoni discussed the possibility of Ahsoka being involved in the Rebel Alliance before the show ended and before Disney acquired Star Wars. That being said, I have enjoyed most of the returns we've seen so far."
False,1,Wasn't the clone wars before Disney?
False,0,If Windu came back he'd have to be a dark sider. Otherwise it would just be Yoda all over again.

False,0,Fives is my top 3 saddest deaths
False,0,I hope echo comes back
False,0,"Well, whole Rebels are about this. But this is Filoni's problem, too. That guy can hardly create something original. That's why Rebels has SW feel - because it recycles the OT and uses old characters,"

False,0,"It really depends on the species. Togruta montrals are hollow, and aid in sensing vibrations, a little like echolocation. Nautolan tendrils are extremely sensitive olfactory organs, especially underwater. Twi'lek lekku are basically like having a prehensile tail. Etc"

False,0,"Assuming you're talking about the Grand Army of the Republic (The Clones), they're both pretty equal in terms of firepower and skill. 
From what I understand, the UNSC would be smaller than the Grand Army, so there's a factor that the Republic wins out on. 
I think it would really be down to what kind of equipment the Spartans have; if they have armor that can resist a lightsaber, then UNSC. If they don't, the Republic based off of the mere fact that Jedi and Spartans are equal in combat prowess, but Jedi can block bullets; Spartans can't keep from being dismembered. It would be a crazy epic war though. "

False,0,He is the best cant lie besides obi wan
False,0,No
False,0,No the actor for Kylo ren is a different actor
False,0,"He is the son of Leia and Han...this will be revealed by a flashback, when his parents bring him to Lukes Academy. "
False,1,And have you seen anything about the new movie or looked up imdb it tells you who the actors are
False,0,No kylo ren was born after thw battle of endor
False,1,"Finn is obviously going to be outmatched. But im unsure of how hes even able to use a lightsabre in the first film. Luke didn't in his first apperance. Hes never sabre in his life (im assuming so from Hans talk to the two newbies on the falcon.) He'll be overpowered easily. The question is, who will save him? That I am looking forward to."
False,2,"Finn a Jedi? Yes. First conflict between Flinn and Ren? Typical Ren overpowers Finn, Finn obviously outmatched and is either saved, hopefully by Luke! Or some diversion takes Ren's attention away from Finn so he can escape. "
False,1,"I think Luke will teach Finn the way of the jedi after his planetfall and meeting Rey. But its a question where and when will he fight Kylo Ren - I think he will lose, but Rey will somehow save him. "
False,2,I hope it's like the fight be Maul and Quigon
False,2,"What if the Jedi way is what Finn decides to fight for? Like, he had nothing to fight for, and then he had something, and that's why he fights. What if there's something (or maybe someone) that he decides to fight for?"
False,1,I think Rey is the one that will become the Jedi. In the trailer she seamed to be missing a role to me. And Finn was the storm trooper that had nothing to fight for.
False,0,That would be awesome if Luke came to fight Kylo! Luke would show him quite a few tricks.
False,1,What if Luke saves Finn? 
False,2,"Yes, and it will be awesome!"
False,2,"Yeah, I have the feeling that Finn may be a fake out, and he's just carrying the lightsaber. He can possibly hold his own with it to a certain extent just through previous combat training as a stormtrooper."
False,0,"While in Legends, Boba Fett was a Mandalorain, within canon it has been confirmed by Pablo Hidalgo that Fett isn't a member of the group.

False,0,"It's spelled Mand'alor! You're not even mandalorian are you?!
Anyway, Boba Fett will always be Mandalore's Mand'alor. 
He saved us from the Yuuzhan Vong and has been the best Mand'alor since Fenn Shysa!"
False,2,Would be sweet keeping him with the old canon of becoming mandalore

False,0,Does JarJar really seem to have the capability and medichlorians to be a Sith?
False,0,It is the least plausible theory ever. They just made it up to make jar jar haters happy

False,0,Mace dead.
False,0,"The only way we would see Mace Windu is if it were a vision or something of that nature, but we most likely will not see him. "
False,0,Well we all thought that darth maul died to but he came back in the clone wars. 
False,0,"Correct, Mace Windu is long since dead so he will not be appearing in the new films."
False,0,Mace windu died during order 66
False,0,Everyone who has been following the news thinks he is
False,0,"I bet it's Sifo-Dyas severely disformed after his ""death"""
False,0,it's possible to be Jar Jar binks there are many theories about that
False,0,"I think it's plausible. Although I don't see why Plagius would have chosen this time to take over, when this (the New Order) is literally the Imperial remnants in all but name. Why now? Yeah Palpatine was in the way, but the Empire had the vast majority of the galaxy under their fist. People are saying its because Plagius could not have taken bith Vader and Sidious at the same time: but they were rarely around each other - Vader was off with the 501st quelling rebellion. Aarrghhh anyways... I like the idea personally. Not sure if it's true though."
False,0,"Rey, autocorrect is such a pain"
False,0,"The writers of the new film confirmed that caedus is non cannon in the new film, 

It's why the new lead try is thought to be Han and lead daughter,

"
False,0,Supreme leader snoke is kylo rens master. Also supreme leader snoke might be darth plageuis 
False,0,I think maybe darth caedus might show up and he might be the sith for the next movies 
False,1,Looking for some serious character progression with Kylo - hoping for some deep backstory and a good logical journey into either Sith prominence or a turn to the Jedi
False,3,"I absolutely love this topic. Here is my two cents lol, I believe Kylo will soon become a Sith Lord seeing as he possess powers for such things already. However, I do not foresee him being the top tier Sith Lord like Palpatine, more or less like Vader since he wants to ""finish what he started"". I do believe there will be a higher power revealed on the same level of Palpatine and I believe that to be Darth Maul. Since most know or should know, he did not die in the first movie. He comes back in the Clone Wars cartoon series and Palpatine tells him he will be of good use later then after, to my knowledge the cartoon was canceled after with no continuation of Darth Maul. Then I did some research on his race: Darthomirian. He is 100% even though having a human mother (that kinda baffled me). But since he was 100%, they can live to up to 100 years. Darth Maul was born 51 BBY and after doing all the math, that would put him at roughly 90 years in the next trilogy and for being dormant all these years he could be training and developing his skills to be perfect. So I really see it as Darth Maul will be the next top tier villain. 

Plus with Anikin, Yoda and Obi-Wan as ghosts for Luke, they all have greater knowledge of his existence."
False,1,He is one of the leaders in the first order but he is also a member of the knights of Ren. He could have his own agenda aside from the first order.
False,0,I think he will be the main villain throughout the trilogy because he wants to finish what Darth Vader started. Plus he's awesome and carries one of the coolest lightsabers. 
False,0,"I think he's going to be like Lumiya, not a true sith at first, but eventually becomes one. I'm hoping he's going to kill Snole in the trilogy, and take an apprentice."
False,0,Well right now kylo isnt a sith becuase he doesnt have the title darth but i think there is somthing or someone like a real sith that will appear in 8 and 9
False,1,"Legends will always be fact and no one can change that. Not Disney, not Lucas, no one. I mean, they're like 90% of the Star Wars universe."
False,1,"Also, if you happen to still believe in Legends, lightsabers are energy. No plasma involved. "
False,1,"It's utter stupidity. He'd be more likely to roast his own face off than do anything effective. And if they's ""exhaust vents"" like Disney says, they wouldn't be able to block anything. "
False,0,"It's a very stupid hilt. But not that bad as Inquisitor's saber, than can't even work."
False,0,Well they weren't intended for hand guards at all. Kylo built his own saber with no knowledge what-so-ever and those are exhaust ports given that the crystal in the hilt is so unstable giving that flaring look to them. I can't source anything for this but I believe it to be more accurate than just hand guards. I'm sure if you check out a page about the crystals on here it'll explain the significance of an unstable one.
False,0,For coolness' sake
False,0,"My guess is it's to protect the wielder's hand from the energy of the two smaller blades. The blade is, according to a recent source, of an ancient design and the two smaller blades are energy exhaust, so the hilt is probably there to protect the wielder."
False,0,*raises hand to agree*
False,0,"Long live EU! Death to Disney!

(Then when the film comes out and is perfect I'll deny ever saying this)"
False,0,"You can say whatever you want, the fact is that the EU is the most complex universe ever created, and it will be hardly beaten."
False,1,And that's why I refuse to don the mouse ears. I remain loyal. 
False,1,"I think that the EU (Legends, whatever) is the greatest example of a constructed universe ever created. Every background character has a name and a story. Every ship and weapon has a tale. Star Wars, to me, isn't about having something entertaining to read when I feel like it (though it is that, too). It's about exploring a whole new, fantastic universe, with endless depth and information. "
False,1,Pretty sure he works for the disney....lol
False,4,It's hard to keep track of some things and characters but I can't get enough of it.
False,0,Is it just me who thinks snoke might turn out to be darth plagueis?
False,0,Isn't this why they're releasing the movie?
False,0,Probably too soon to tell. I bet Snoke will last until at least Episode IX.
False,0,Lost Stars. It's a great way to refresh your memory of the original trilogy without watching the same movies again
False,0,Han Solo trilogy were really fun books 
False,0,"Ok, so, I want to start from the beginning and read towards now. "
False,0,"""нan ѕolo: ѕмυgglerѕ rυn "" ιѕ aмazιng "
False,1,"Darth Matman, there is no reason not to read or watch legends materials. True they are not cannon now, but if there is no conflict then there is no reason to say it didn't happen. Side note to question asked Thrawn trilogy is fantastic."
False,1,"If you are wanting to do so to find out more about the Star Wars universe then I am sad to say that majority of the novels are no longer canon. When the new movie was announced it was also announced that much of what was canon is no longer canon. The main things that are canon are the movies, the battle of the clones series, and the force unleashed games. I strongly disagree with this but sadly, that is the way it is."
False,0,Lost Stars also exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend. 
False,1,"X-Wing series, Darth Bane trilogy, Thrawn trilogy."
False,2,the darth bane trilogy is really good 
False,0,"Aftermath and the other novels in the Journey to The Force Awakens series are definitely a good place to start if you want to start seeing the story that leads into Episode VII. A New Dawn is also a good place to start, since that was the first book of the new canon. It's a prequel to Star Wars Rebels."
False,1,"Ignore the stupid ""reshaping the Force"" osik. Disney canon is idiotic. Basically, the Tarkin Doctrine is about ruling through fear. The Rebellion is successful only through the ""stateless philosophy"" in which it never holds actual significant territory, and instead wages guerrilla warfare, hiding out on countless planets. The purpose of the Death Star was to make the cost of sheltering Rebels so severe that no planet would dare to do so. "
False,0,There's no reason other than bachelor pad. You hit it spot on. Mon mothma would go there and whore around some of the main hangars for fresh imperial men.
False,1,"To put it simply, if you were able to create a machine to give you the ability to blow up a planet, wouldn't you?"
False,1,"The novel Star Wars: Tarkin started to shed some light on that. Other than being a military tool to keep order and try to scare systems into being loyal to the Empire, the book hinted that it was part of the Emperor's plans to control the Force and reshape it to his liking."

PT: ..... Could tell you lol"
False,0,*if you haven't already 
False,0,Yo if you guys like darth plagueis you would read the book on him 
False,0,I agree with the plagueis theory since Palpatine is known for being a faker and a lier he could have lied about killing his former master in his sleep
False,1,I really want it to be darth plagueis. there is a lot of stuff pointing to it being him. but most likely it won't be him 
False,0,"I'm really interested to see who he is too. I think J.J. Abrams said he was a practitioner of the dark side of the Force. Part of me wonders if he's the mysterious fleet admiral we saw at the end of ""Aftermath."""
False,0,Very nice points there James
False,1,"Abrams is a phenomenal director, I couldn't tell you a work I am not always being one uped by with him and keep in mind, Lucas is still a producer so he's not going to let the production go to shit and the writers for this film are new except for 2 or 3 of them which worked on the original trilogy and have written for the EU since the beginning. I believe it'll do fine."
False,0,I think you're right. The Force Awakens might possibly be the best Star Wars film. 
False,1,Maybe people are just overreacting and this will be the best one yet.
False,2,"It's not JJ I'm worried about, it's Disney."
False,1,"Plus with how close together the release of each film is, I don't think J.J. Abrams could have realistically managed post-production on Episode VII and pre-production on Episode VIII at the same time."
False,1,"From all the trailers and insider reports it sounds like he did a great job. That said I like how each film has a different director, one who can bring their own distinctive style to the film - especially Rian Johnson, who will probably make a very different Star Wars movie than we're used to. The original trilogy had three different directors and that was successful, so I'm optimistic about what the three directors of this trilogy will do."
False,0,She'll be like Yoda was in the OT
False,1,I believe the next Jedi will be Maz Kanata. 
False,0,Disney took a big old steamy poop on the new order and the rest of the cannon.  The writers will not use any characters that they themselves haven't created or haven't already been seen on film.  All print characters are dead.  R.I.P. Talon Karde
False,0,Definitely think Rey is on the path to becoming a Jedi
False,0,I agree with brandon. I hope that luke started the new jedi order.
False,0,"I wouldn't be surprised if there were already some Jedi with Luke by the time we see him in the movie. But in terms of the main characters, my guess is that Rey will end up becoming a Jedi. She seems like she's going to be the new main character of this trilogy."
False,0,"If you do not know, read the wiki page. If there is nothing on it, we do not know, there is only speculation "
False,0,"Rex, Wolffe, and Gregor all went on to live in a modified AT-TE walker on the planet Seelos. They met up with the rebels about 15 years after the clone wars ended."
False,0,"We don't know where he was yet or if he knows what happened to Anakin, but I'm guessing we'll find out more as season 2 progresses. "
False,0,I remember that. But where was he during the order 66? And did he know Anakin is Vader?
False,0,He removed his chip after one of the other clones when crazy and killed a Jedi in the last season. So did a few other clones. I believe it is the first episode of seasons 6 and it follows on for the next few episodes
False,0,Kylo Ren is not a sith. He is one of the Knights of Ren. A next step evolution of the sith. But with new laws
False,0,No. The Sith are dead and gone.
False,0,We need more Darth
False,0,I hope so
False,0,Well Jacen Solo becomes Darth Caedus in 40 ABY force awakens is set in about 33 ABY so unless the sixth stopped it and brought it back then I don't see why not 
False,0,I think it would be cool if a new Sith wouldn't have this title. But people probably will want them to have it.
False,2,"I think they should, but not at first. I'm hoping Kylo Ren follows in Lumiya's footsteps and resurrects the Sith."
False,0,"Darth Maul. Darth Tyranus. Darth Sidious. Darth Vader. Darth Darth Darth. There's too many of them! In my opinion, if there are any Sith in the new trilogy, they should not call themselves Darth. There was a time when Darth was not a title, but rather a first name; Darth Vader was the character's name, not his title. That's why Obi-Wan called him ""Darth."" Over time, though, Darth evolved to be a title, which we first saw with Darth Maul, but there are plenty of Sith in Legends stories who don't use that title. Ajunta Pall, Marka Ragnos, Freedon Nadd, and so forth. I want to see the movies do something new, with a character whose name is just their name, not a Darth title. I think that can help humanize the character, when you know them as a distinctive personality rather than just yet another in a long line of people with the same name that looks like the writers are trying to cash in on Darth Vader's pop culture status."
False,0,I hope not
False,0,The character handing the saber to Rey is the ancient alien Maz Kanata. She will be a Yoda type character voiced by Noyong'o and played by a Henson Studio Muppet.
False,0,That would be cool but doubtful
False,0,she could be the person who is talking to rey in the trailer and the one who hands her the lightsaber but who knows 
False,0,"Probably not. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a reference to animated characters in Rogue One, though. Maybe a nod to ""Commander Tano"" or ""Captain Syndulla."""
False,0,"No way, Disney/Lucas Film announced that there will be no character appeared in movies, who was first introduced in animated series or comics. At the same time I have a feeling that Ahsoka will die in this or the next season of STR."
False,1,That would be so cool it was so sad when she left the Jedi order in the clone wars and in the new season rebels her story continues...
False,0,We might becuase she did survive order 66 
False,0,"Please, no."
False,0,That would be so cool
False,0,Cause I can give it!
False,1,"The most powerful side is the Grey side.
Jensaarai are able to defeat Sith and Jedi alike because they understand them and have both sides of abilities.
Look at Mace Windu: He was nearly a Grey and defeated Darth Sidious who not even Darth Vader (the force user with the highest count of midichlorians) or Yoda (the wisest ""most powerful"" Jedi) could.
Need more proof?"
False,0,To quote Ben Kenobi: strike me down and I will become more powerful than you could ever imagine.
False,1,"The Dark Side is the quick and easy way to potentially near-limitless power. But if you instead choose to invest the time and discipline needed to master the Light Side of the Force, you can be just as powerful, but at less cost to your own being. "
False,0,"I think it's less ""The Dark side offers more power quickly but the light side is more powerful if you stay true/are redeemed"" and more ""The Dark side has more brute-force power, but in order to effectively use said powers you must embrace destructive tendencies that commonly kill off the Sith; Anger, Aggression, Fear, Obsessive passion, etc., while the Light side offers the same amount of power (depending on the ""Balance of the Force"" I suppose), but not at the expense of your life or happiness."".
   "
False,0,the darkside offers more power quickly but the lights takes more time. both have pros and cons but the darkside can be more powerful because it is faster to gain power 
False,0,You become more powerful on the dark side becuase your not affraid to use it to your own desire. And the force is so strong within the dark side that the sith is able to stop people from dying
False,0,You become more powerful on the dark side becuase your not affraid to use the force for your own desire.
False,0,"You are the most powerful, if you understand both sides. You have to join the dark side and the come back."
False,0,I think you gain new powers when joining  the dark side but won't necessarily be more powerful unless you learn control while being able to resist the dark side takes control and strength you still won't have all the powers of a sith so power wise you joining the dark side would be the way to go. Unless your yoda ;)
False,0,DARTH BANE

False,0,I would say Raven he has slated many enemies and armies so yeah
False,0,"Revan is known as Revanchrist, basically a God of the force, in my opinion he would win."
False,0,And bane had his obalisk armor
False,1,"The main part Both of you are missing is which Revan and which Bane. Just saying Revan, without saying what part of his life and the same with Bane, is nothing. I am also seeing very little backing to your claims. 
Bane destroyed and created a sith order, amassed a collection of force history/teachings, and managed to hold his own against powerful Jedi and other beings"
False,0,"Revan slew entire armies, was both Jedi and Sith, and could nearly defeat the Sith emperor. I personally think he is more powerful in nearly every aspect and he would win."
False,0,But once it come to Sabres Bane will slice right through him
False,0,"Revan, he fought and defeated greater opponents than Bane."

False,1,It looks like he sort of melts their brain from the inside from what I see 
False,0,He just has to play dirty like the rest of them. 
False,0,All Sith and Jedi have mind manipulation. He is just determined to unleash the sith souls that Luke guards.
False,0,Perhaps telepathy
False,0,"Kreia, Darth Bane and Jolee Bindo."
False,1,Darth Malgus
False,1,Although I do have to say that I'm somewhat of a fan of Kyp Durron.
False,1,"I was never really into the post-RotJ EU although some of the characters and concepts were interesting. The pre-phantom menace eu I love almost more than the movies. My favorite eu character would have to be someone from the old republic era, maybe Bane or Revan "
False,1,"Torn between Thrawn, and Revan"
False,1,Darth Malgus 
False,2,Darth star killer from dark side edition of Force unleashed 2
False,1,"Brandon Rhea - for me it is canon, but I really don't care what is canon and what isn't. There are bad things in both the EU and canon, and same goes for the good things. As for me, I take official Disney canon as an alternate universe. But this is offtopic, and every non-casual SW fan knows the difference."
False,1,Quinlan Vos
False,0,Fives (clone wars)
False,0,"That's what I'm guessing. And yes sorry, forgot the name. "
False,0,"I think the Acolytes of the Beyond probably have something to do with the Knights of Ren. Maybe they become the Knights of Ren? They seem to worship Darth Vader and that's what Kylo Ren does, so there definitely seems to be an implied connection."
False,0,Acolytes of the Beyond you mean? 
False,0,"JAR JAR
MORE JAR JAR
Actually, due to speculation, one could deduce that the Antagonist of TFA could be either Darth Plaguis-I doubt it-,Sifo-Dyas-my personal guess or a prominent character from the background. "
False,0,"Some speculate that ""Darth"" is an overused term, and it will be much more interesting with a change like that."
False,0,He is a knight of ren 
False,0,The obviously he is not a Sith Lord only two can the be
False,0,"I think that the ""first order"" is a legion of storm troopers that are force users. "
False,0,I agree but I did some research and he is part of the nights of ren 
False,0,"""Ren"" is the Knights of Ren equivalent to ""Darth"" of the sith. While Kylo Ren isnt technically sith, the Knights are an organization with similar motives from the dark side of the force."
False,0,"Kylo is only a puppet. He has no idea what is he doing, and will pay for it. He is too weak for a villain, and a Revan-like mask won' save it."
False,0,"I think The Knights of Ren are just another force organization that allied with the First Order. If I'm not mistaken, then none of the other knights have lightsabers. I heard kylo ren's was just a modification to Darth Vader's because not many people left in the galaxy know how to create one. I think he is special and maybe the leader of them. It also might be a bit of a Darth Maul character and die in the first movie of the trilogy. Idk but I'm excited for the movie!!!
"
False,0,"Agreed! He's definitely not a Sith. (SPOILER ALERT) Whatever the Knights of Ren are they're definitely something else, but Kylo for sure seems motivated by the legacy of Darth Vader."
False,1,I think kylo ren is trying to avenge Darth Vaders Death bt rebuilding the sith order
False,0,"I've said this a lot, but I think Luke and Leia both become Jedi and go into exile."
False,0,no. he doesn't. after a final battle with the empire he loses friends and a large portion of the rebels. without obi wan or yoda for guidance he renounces the force and supposedly becomes a hermit on tatooine. but then he comes back. he is NOT kylo ren 
False,0,"No way!! In TROTJ, he realized that the light side is better than the dark and at the same time that the LS brings piece to the world, but the DS destroys the world. So I really doubt it!"
False,0,"Extremely doubtful. My guess is he is in hiding from his previous student that turned to the dark side, Kylo Ren"
False,0,Not sure but it's very possible because in episode 6 he dose she what it's like but I doubt it
False,0,"Only time will tell! I doubt it, though."
False,0,My tears
False,0,Kylo Ren and the First Order! 
False,0,I do wanna see if the movie added ANY EU aspects. I can't bear to see the universe be discarded. 
False,0,I want to see what Luke does and I want to see the new droid BT-8
False,0,Hard to believe it's less than two weeks away. (I have a pre-ordered ticket to an early December 17 showing.) Feels like it just sorta crept up. I don't know that there's really one particular thing I'm aching to see - I'm just really hoping to enjoy the whole film.
False,1,Wanna see what happens to Luke. A lot of speculation that he may have fallen to the dark side in some way and he hasnt been seen in any of the trailers (except for one quick shot of a hooded Luke with R2).
False,0,And it's only two weeks here :P
False,0,"Not going to watch this movie, muhahaha."
False,0,"I have a guess as to part of the plot, and can't wait to see if I'm right."
False,3,I wonder if Leia is a jedi like in the old EU ...
False,0,"Very true Vathrein, very true."
False,0,"At the Battle of Galidraan, Jango killed five Jedi with nothing but his bare hands. Spartans are nothing next to Jedi. And Boba is arguably even more skilled than his father. "
False,0,No contest. Either one of the Fetts alone could kill a dozen Spartans. 
False,1,"Maul's lightsaber has four separate crystals, not one. Using ACTUAL lightsaber mechanics (not that Disney osik), it would be physically impossible for one crystal to focus two blades in opposite directions. Crystals don't power the lightsaber, they just focus the energy of the power cell into a blade. Maul's lightsaber runs on two separate power cells, the energy of each of which is focused by two focusing crystals. Obi-Wan's lightsaber severed one of the power cells, disabling that side of the lightsaber, but the other was still intact. "
False,0,There is a crystal for each blade
False,5,"It presumably has two crystals, which is why Maul was also able to use a single blade. Both ends activated independently of one another, so cutting the hilt down the middle wouldn't cut the crystal in half."
False,0,It's like killing a snake. Cut off the head it will still bite
False,0,As with most things in Episode I
False,1,Probably didn't put a lot of thought into 
False,0,Because we like to put mouse ears and huge checks everywhere and call it kid-friendly. 
False,0,Because the blaster is charged from the crystal and it's not powerful enough to make a blast that can actually kill.
False,0,He doesn't like to hurt people
False,0,"He's a kid, he probably doesn't want to kill. But I'd like to see getting him killed :D"
False,0,"Please keep your comments civil, Moboggie. Thanks."
False,0,Cause he's a Disney bitch
False,0,"We've never seen him kill before, I don't think he would kill if he had the chance. "
False,0,How do you download it
False,0,It's true like Parma amadala I love her and her outfits 
False,0,What do you mean?
False,0,"Droids can be force sensitive only in extended universe, not in canon."
False,0,They know their coming they act surprised to trick the droids in thinking that they are dome
False,0,YES
False,0,I am sure Luke is the dark master of Kylo Ren. In one of the trailers kylo does not wear the mask and he's not Luke. But Luke must be his master
False,0,I think he will be a figure like Obi-wan... A guy off the records and chased by the empire!
False,0,"I don't think that Luke will be Kylo Ren, because:
1.He is the master of the new Jedi Order.
2.He hasn't got any reasons for it.
"
False,0,"I do believe the theory of Han being more of a main character, especially because he is seen more in promotional materials and because I believe that Leia became a Jedi, And because the Empire (or at least the First order) exists, she is probably in exile (along with Luke) so Han is seen more, and that also would give him a more interesting back story for the director to work off of. Just my opinion, and I'm not entirely sure how true it actually is."
False,1,With frankwolf he is the chosen one and also you don't see his name in starting you see Harrison ford so maybe Han is the main character 
False,0,I would agree 
False,0,I don't know I have been wondering that too.
False,0,Kylo Ren... He's Kylo Ren.
False,0,Would you consider quilan vos a grey Jedi 
False,1,"They just want to hype it up, nothing else. This will be Han's movie, not Luke's."
False,0,Ahsoka is awesome!!!  Great to see her in action again
False,0,"Andrewrozell - it aired on Disney XD last night. I watched it on watchdisneyxd.com. You can also get on iTunes right now, I think, if you have an Apple account.

Starborngirl - totally agreed!"
False,0,"I found the fact that they had to babysit the babies hilarious. It was also amazing when Ahsoka fought, I didn't realise I was holding my breath u till it was over. It was a heartwarming yet serious episode- I loved it! Plus with Ezra's slip up we're bound to see more action soon!"
False,0,Where are you watching it? 
False,0,Darth dingleberry says yes 
False,0,Yes I'm going to preorder tickets for the midnight premiere 
False,2,"Nope, I'll read about the plot on Wookieepedia."
False,1,I am seeing it in the first day! :)
True,1,Will be there opening day as well. Super excited! 
False,1,Wouldn't miss it. Can't wait!
False,1,On opening day!! Can't wait.
False,1,Yep! 
False,1,Yes!
